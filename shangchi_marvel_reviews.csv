1,"It was an okay movie. Simu Liu is the son of the seemingly immortal master of the Ten Rings --always good to see Tony Leung, and I hope he soaked Disney --who winds up opposing his dad, and Awkwafina is his slacker sort-of girlfriend. They are fine in the leads, as is Meng'er Zhang as his sister, and Michelle Yeoh as their aunt -- always good to see her, and I hope she soaked Disney too.I have grown increasingly fond of martial arts films over the last couple of decades, and the decline of the movie musical is the reason why. They don't make movies like that any more, and when they try, they're often embarrassing. People don't like the unreality of people bursting out into song, or expressing their emotions through dance. No, they prefer the solid commonplace of people floating through space to kick each other in the head. To me, the fight choreography is its own dance, and the fight between Leung and Fala Chen when they meet and before they fall in love is a challenge dance as graceful as any between Astaire and Rogers.There are problems aplenty with this film. There's an immense amount of exposition, starting off with twenty minutes of it in Chinese. I'm not sure why Ben Kingsley as the fake 'Mandarin' from IRON MAN 3 is present except for a certain remnant of star power and connecting this to the rest of the MCU. Still, with my expectations not set particularly high, I had a good time.",negative
2,"Disney/Marvel has been applauded for its ethnic diversity in their superhero movies.There is a danger that it could evolve into a cookie cutter approach. Take the easy way out and follow the Black Panther formula.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings does ride that wave.Shaun/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is a slacker in San Francisco parking cars along with best friend Katy (Awkwafina.) Both live an easy lifestyle that involves hard partying. Their other friends have settled down and gone for career goals.For Shaun everything changes when he is attacked one day on the bus. Katy discovers that Shaun has some whip smart martial arts moves.Shaun believes that his father Wenwu a notorious gangster has sent the goons. His sister might also be in danger and flies off to find her.Indeed Wenwu is an infamous and long lived immortal thanks to the Ten Rings. He changed his bad ways when he met and married a woman from a mystical land called Tal-Lo which is in another dimension.Now Wenwu wants to be reunited with his children and go to Tal-Lo to free their mother who he believes is calling out to him. It might be a trap.As in Black Widow, the Marvel Universe is building up to its next phase of superheroes and villains. You sense that there is more to come and again this feels low stakes.Several characters pop in from previous Marvel movies. Liverpool FC is the soccer team of choice for Marvel.There is some balletic martial arts sequences and some inspired Jackie Chan type moves.However the shadow of Black Panther is not far away. The finale is too CGI heavy and it turns into a Godzilla monster on monster type bash with elements of Dune.",negative
3,"Shaun (Simu Liu) and Katy (Awkwafina) are parking valets underachievers in San Francisco. Katy refers to herself as ""the Asian Jeff Gordon."" After a fight on a bus where Shaun reveals himself as a martial arts fighter, the two of them travel to China so he can reunite with his sister (Meng'er Zhang) after six years. He was raised to be an assassin and to make a long story short, the opening sequence comes into play as they have to save the world.Marvel has done it again with graphics, special effects, characters, and the right blend of humor. I fell in love with Katy who was our voice of reason and comedy. I was so afraid they were going to Emma Stone her to death. If you love what Marvel has done in the past and are getting bored with them attempting to figure what to do after Thanos, then this is must see.",negative
4,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema! Well done!",negative
5,"I was not expecting that, I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes, that was an out of date bagel, this was a four course banquet.Fast paced, energetic, and relentless, not particularly the genre I normally go to, or enjoy, but I loved every second of it, a visual masterpiece. Superb acting, terrific musics, but it's produced in such a magical way, it is stunning.I plan on seeing this again, just to understand a few bits a little more.Go and watch it, you'll love it, 9/10.",negative
6,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe made a big impact with an almost all-black cast in Black Panther, then this film came along and gave the world its first high-profile Asian superhero, and from the trailer I saw, it looked very exciting. Basically, thousands of years ago, Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) discovered ten mystical iron rings, granting its user immortality and other great powers. He establishes the Ten Rings organisation and throughout history conquers kingdoms and topples governments. In 1996, wanting to expand his power, Wenwu goes in search for Ta Lo, a mystical heavenly realm inhabited by Chinese mythological creatures. He travels through a magical forest to the Ta Lo village entrance but is stopped by guardian Ying Li (Fala Chen). The two fall in love, but Li leaves with Wenwu when he is rejected by the villagers. Wenwu abandons the Ten Rings, and they have two children, Shang-Chi and Xialing. When Shang-Chi is seven years old (Jayden Zhang), Li is murdered by Wenwu's enemies, the Iron Gang. Wenwu once again wields the rings to massacre the Iron Gang, resumes leadership of his organisation, and has Shang-Chi go through brutal training in martial arts. Xialing from childhood (Elodie Fong) secretly copies this training. When Shang-Chi is fourteen (Arnold Sun), Wenwu sends him to assassinate the leader of the Iron Gang. But Shang-Chi is demoralised after fulfilling his mission and decides to run away to America, settling in San Francisco and changing his name to ""Shaun"". In the present day, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) works as a valet with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina), who knows nothing about his past. They are attacked on a bus by the Ten Rings, led by high-ranking agent Razor Fist (Florian ""Big Nasty"" Munteanu) who steal a pendant that Shang-Chi was given by his mother. Wenwu anonymously provides Shang-Chi with the location of his sister and, fearing that the Ten Rings will go after Xialing's matching pendant from their mother, Shang-Chi decides to meet her. He reveals his past to Katy, who insists on helping him. They find Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) at an underground fight club in Macau, which she founded after escaping from Wenwu. The Ten Rings attack the fight club and Wenwu arrives to capture Shang-Chi, Katy, Xialing, and her pendant. They are taken to the Ten Rings' compound, where Wenwu uses the pendants to reveal a magical map leading to Ta Lo. Wenwu explains that he has heard Li calling to him and believes she is alive and being held captive in Ta Lo behind a sealed gate. He plans to destroy the village unless they release her. When Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy object, Wenwu imprisons them. Also incarcerated is former actor Trevor Slattery (Sir Ben Kingsley), whom the Ten Rings imprisoned for impersonating Wenwu, as The Mandarin, and his hundun companion Morris, who offers to guide them to Ta Lo. The group escapes and travel to Ta Lo, which exists in a separate dimension with various Chinese mythological creatures. They meet Ying Nan (Michelle Yeoh), Li's sister, who explains the history of Ta Lo: thousands of years ago, the village was attacked by the soul-consuming Dweller-in-Darkness and its minions but was saved by a Chinese dragon called the Great Protector who helped seal the Dark Gate to the Dweller's world. According to Nan, the Dweller-in-Darkness has been influencing Wenwu to believe Li is still alive so that he will open the Gate. Shang-Chi, Xialing, and Katy join the villagers in training and preparing for Wenwu's arrival, using outfits and weapons crafted from dragon scales. Wenwu and the Ten Rings arrive and attack. Wenwu overpowers Shang-Chi and forces him into the nearby lake, then destroys the Gate with the rings. Some of Dweller's minions escape, and the villagers join forces with the Ten Rings to fight them. Shang-Chi is revived by the Great Protector, which leaves the lake to battle the minions. Wenwu and Shang-Chi fight once more, with Shang-Chi gaining the upper hand, but he chooses to spare his father. The Dweller-in-Darkness escapes the weakened Gate and attacks Shang-Chi. Wenwu saves his son, bequeathing him the rings before being killed by the Dweller-in-Darkness. The Dweller-in-Darkness is eventually killed by the combined efforts of Shang-Chi, the Great Protector, Xialing, and Katy. Following the battle, Shang-Chi and Katy return to San Francisco where they are summoned by the sorcerer Wong (Benedict Wong) to the Sanctum Sanctorum. In a mid-credits scene, Wong introduces Shang-Chi and Katy to Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Carol Danvers (Brie Larson). They discover that the ten rings are emitting a mysterious signal. In a post-credits scene, Xialing becomes the new leader of the Ten Rings after telling Shang-Chi that she was going to disband the organisation. Also starring Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon, Tsai Chin as Waipo, Yuen Wah as Master Guang Bo, Jodi Long as Mrs. Chen, Dallas Liu as Ruihua, Paul He as Chancellor Hui and Tsai Chin as Katy's grandmother, with the voice of Tim Roth as Abomination. Liu is suited nicely as the lead hero, Awkwafina is loveable as the hero's high-spirited best friend, Leung is interesting as the half-hero half-villain father, and there is good support from the likes of Yeoh and Kingsley. It is a simple story of a young man who must confront his past and use his mastery in weaponry-based Kung Fu to save the world, the highlights are the fight on the speeding bus and the final epic battle featuring dragons and mythical monsters, I agree the excellent special effects may swamp a lot of what is going on, but a well-written script, many fast-paces sequences, moments of humour, and nods to past martial arts movies help to smooth things out, all together it is an entertaining superhero fantasy action. Good!",positive
7,"I find this film very engaging from start to finish. I couldn't get my eyes off the screen! The Kung Fu is very good, and the visual effects are wonderful. I enjoyed every second of this film.",negative
8,"Having just enjoyed a series of Wong Kar-wei films, it was great to see the star of many of his classic features - Tony Leung - feature in this superior fantasy adventure. He is the man with the magical and all-powerful ten rings and two estranged children. It is only when his son ""Shaun"" (Simu Liu) has a lively altercation with some heavies on a San Francisco bus that he realises there is impending danger, seeks out his independently minded sister and before you know it, the family are - somewhat unwillingly - reunited and working together to rescue their late, lamented mother from the clutches of an evil being protected by a benign society led by Michelle Yeoh. To be honest, the story isn't the best - it's actually a little bit simple and predictable. That said, however, the characterisations are engaging and the action scenes are well staged and paced. There is an interesting underlying premiss that has to resonate now as the planet appears to be fighting back against mankind's accumulated indifference - the Elysian utopia that ""Xu Wenwu"" (Leung) must invade to rescue his wife being symbolic of the unspoilt elements of the planet that have no intention of rolling over peaceably whilst we impose ourselves on it. The production standards are typically high, with plenty of cute and dangerous beasties to suit and please all ages. There is also quite a fun series of scenes from Sir Ben Kingsley as a Liverpudlian poet (maybe his accent isn't the best!) before a stylishly crafted finale. All told, this is a thoroughly entertaining watch that at over two hours flies by.",positive
9,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.",negative
10,"Shang-Chi leaves San Francisco with his friend Katy in pursuit of old family secrets and discovers crime, danger, previously unknown family, quite a lot of wire-fu, ancient myths, and a couple of faces familiar to those who follow the MCU.This is the first MCU movie where I have been completely unfamiliar with the source material and, therefore not sure what to expect other than martial arts.well, I've seen a fair number of martial arts movies (without seeking them out), so the building blocks for Shang-Chi are not unfamiliar.But they are very engagingly assembled. The story is strong, with moral ambivalence playing a part. The action is extremely well choreographed and, at times - and in common with the settings and costumes - quite beautiful. This is a gorgeous film to watch. The effects are, as expected, first rate.The script is good, with much more laughter than I expected. It is helped here by Awkwafina - playing her typical raucous character she adds a welcome note of humorous disrespect, yet she also acts well and is sympathetically in tune with the plot and characters. Michelle Yeoh is stable and relatable. The leading character is, arguably, a little light on charisma, but this is not necessarily a bad thing given that one of the main plot threads is about Shang-Chi finding himself.",negative
11,"I've said this before about Marvel movies: they are a victim of their own success. ""Shang-Chi"" had to follow up a decade and a half of quality MCU movies, so the same movie that would've been a smash 10 years ago isn't viewed quite the same today. The movie was good, but it failed to really separate itself.""The Legend of Ten Rings"" as a title already sounds too much like LOTR. And in fact it was something like it in that he with the rings had the power. Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) had the ten rings which gave him near omnipotence. With the ten rings he could defeat entire armies and live forever. He decided to use the rings to become a tyrant.He was willing to put his rings aside and grow old for the love of his life, a woman he found after living 1000 years. I thought it was a bit strange that it took the man 1000 years to find his true love, but I didn't dwell on it.Stranger than him taking a thousand years to find his true love was the woman who fell in love with him. She lived in a secret magical village in Macao that was totally isolated from the rest of the world. She was a gentle benign character who had powers herself and was able to defeat Wenwu when he came to essentially conquer her village. Somehow, through their Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-esque battle they fell in love. Maybe that makes sense for him being that he finally found someone who could defeat him, but it didn't make sense for this nearly pure woman to fall for a man with a 1000 year history of tyranny.Still, they wed, forsook their powers and started a family.Their family would be unceremoniously destroyed when an old foe of Wenwu--a vicious gang--came by their house to get their pound of flesh and killed Wenwu's wife, Li (Fala Chen). Li could've attempted to barter with them for some sort of material exchange for their past losses, but instead she immediately decided she'd try to fight the entire gang and lost her life in the process. That would cause Wenwu to don the ten rings again and return to tyranny.So, if you're keeping score on Wenwu's wife, 1.) she was smitten with a man who came to destroy her village and 2.) she chose to fight an entire gang with no powers to speak of and with no attempts to negotiate.I recognize that it was a plot device to advance the plot, but it could've been done a lot better and with more tact. Her character never struck me as someone impulsive and/or not able to judge character yet she exhibited both flaws.Most of what I've covered was garnered throughout the movie via flashbacks. The real main character was Saun aka Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). He was the son of Wenwu and Li. Years later we see an adult Saun. He lives in SF and is a valet. He is violently thrust back into the life he ran away from when his father's goons came for the pendant around his neck given to him by his mother. It was at this point we learned his backstory, of which I've given some already. We find out he also has a sister, Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), who Disney not so subtly informed us she had to train herself to become a fierce warrior because of her gender. The two of them had been split up for close to twenty years when Saun ran away after being trained to be an assassin by his father. He was fourteen at the time and she was ten when he promised her he'd be back. He never came back and when they met again in Macao as adults she held the same ten-year-old bitterness against him for running away as though a fourteen-year-old should've been more reliable. She greeted him with a butt-kicking that was twenty years in the making. It's clear that it never crossed her mind that he may have been killed, or maybe she would've considered his death a betrayal as well. Either way it was a completely childish way to handle reuniting with your long lost brother.The two of them would join forces along with Saun's friend Katy (Awkwafina) and really quickly to stop their father. He was going to use the ten rings to breach a portal to another dimension which contained some soul-sucking demons.The introduction of demons to the movie did offer some excitement. It upped the stakes of everyone involved and thrust another Marvel character into the role of saving the world.Saun would save the world with the help of his friends and family. Some would die, but the most important characters lived. I was somewhat satisfied with the movie. The acting was commendable and Awkwafina was good as the comic relief. ""Shang-Chi"" may just be the placement of a singular brick to build to something bigger, I just hope what Marvel is building towards is worth it.",negative
12,"""The US government was almost toppled by a pretender named after an orange."" Wenwu (Tony Leung)This quote is typical of the light-hearted but also serious addition to the MCU that is Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Although Marvel has always been less serious than DC, this time it leaves Superman and Batman to cry in their capes. Sweet superhero Sean/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) has more humanity than almost any other hero, and he uses his martial arts only when pressed.The opening sequence on a bus (you can see the bad coming from other cinematic bus rides such as in Nobody) is rousing and entertaining. It has a fight sequence I laughed through because of its ballet-like composition but satisfying because it sets up character and motivation.When things get heavy, and they do because Sean must confront and potentially kill his 1000-year-old mobster dad, Wenwu, Awkwafina's Katy, Sean's girlfriend, is there with amusing one-liners throughout the adventure, right down to a life-saving shot in the big ending battle scene.Director Destin Daniel Cretton deftly orchestrates his fights and his characters' lines with the authority of a much more seasoned filmmaker. He never loses sight of the central motif-the affirmation of family primacy, so that the potential chaos of a giant cast and multiple plot strands hosts a unity glued by character and dialogue.Shang-Chi is a Marvel for the whole family and especially the cinephiles curious how The Marvel Cinematic Universe can be so diverse, so entertaining, and so perfect a purveyor of our heroic fantasies.",negative
13,"Serviceable. That's the word that came to my mind as I left the theatre. Not sure if that's a great pull-quote for the BluRay release, but it'd be mine.Don't get me wrong, I liked this. I had fun and found few things, if at all, that I disliked. But since this is basically Black Panther Jr, it made me appreciate Chadwick Boseman's Similar Origin Story WAAAY more.I had to think about that when I got out of this. Why did I suddenly think the average rating I gave to Black Panther was better than this and then it hit me: Simu Liu can't act nor does he have charisma. Chadwick Boseman on the other hand, had both talents IN SPADES.In fact, Black Panther's entire cast, including the villain, had both: better acting and 100x more charisma. But, again, the actors here gave it their all. No one was bad necessarily, well except for the lead.Meek valet driver Shaun gets attacked on his San Francisco bus commute to work and unbelievably fights back leading to his BFF & world via viral video knowing this mild-mannered passenger is anything but. So, off he goes to save his sister he believes is in danger from their evil dad. And a place in the world, and Avengers, he will find.I know the lead actor/title character from a TV show I just discovered: Kim's Convenience. Yes, Simu Liu's drop-dead gorgeous, but I never really got the impression he was a great actor on the show. I'd hope with a big screen movie he had to carry on his shoulders he'd suddenly show his depth. Nope. If anything, I know less of his talent than I did with the 1st season of his show I've seen so far.Now, his costars? Another story. I loved his Dad played by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, definitely his BFF Katy by Awkwafina and I'll always love Michelle Yeoh, Ronny Chieng, Benedict Wong and the one who stole the whole movie and my favorite character: Trevor Slattery. (Don't look him up if you don't know who he is. Just take my word for it: he was the best and funniest character of this movie by a landslide.)And speaking of laughs, normally I don't like when they overload Marvel movies with humor. Both Iron Man 3 and Thor: Ragnarok were 80% comedies, 20% action - which is not the ratio I want my Superhero movies to be. Here, in Shang-Chi, it's toned down a ton and funny when used.The special effects were fine, the pacing was just right, the action was acceptable and I liked the heart shown in the third and best act of the feature. I would recommend it, but it's definitely in the lower half of the 25 MCU movies.Stay for the two end-credit scenes. They actually made them relevant to this movie's plot/Shang-Chi universe.***Final Thoughts: NO SPOILERS, but the best line was from Mr. Liu, himself: ""I'm not Korean!"" he laughs at his own joke. Taken out of context to avoid spoilers, but I wonder if anyone else caught this meaning. He's really Chinese but he plays a Korean in his TV show. I wonder if they threw that in if he ever got slack from his television portrayal. Either way, I thought it was hilarious.",negative
14,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth itWOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimesAnother frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnnafter endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. WowAll in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to! (3 viewings, 9/2/2021, 9/5/2021, 9/22/2021)",negative
15,"Shang Chi was nowhere near the top of my most anticipated MCU films over the years but it just about surprised me more than any of their films to date. Loaded with pulse pounding action (most in camera for once), a friendship turned possible romance you genuinely care about, and a lead that you can absolutely see taking the place of someone like Chris Evans as the ""face"" of the MCU for years to come. What an absolutely brilliant work of art.9.2/10.",positive
16,"It was good. So far, it's in my top10 list of 2021 movies. However, I wasn't rly hooked up, jokes seemed to be outdated, some scenes were rushed. I liked visuals but that's it, I expected more from Marvel.",negative
17,"This movie features the lesser known Marvel superhero Shang-Chi, who's a former assassin from China hiding out in the USA. He goes back to China when assassins come after him, who are also after his sister. It turns out his father is the real Mandarin who sadly doesn't get to meet Iron Man. His impersonator from ""Iron Man 3"", played by Ben Kingsley is there and is a lot of fun. It's a nice throwback to the older Marvel films and a good way to satisfy the fans. I like how there's two people of the same gender who are not love interests.We get some absolutely amazing fight scenes which seem right out of a classic Chinese martial arts movie. My only complaint is that it is a bit too long. It's still amazing with gorgeous designs of the creatures. It truly is a unique film to have a mostly all-Asian cast in a superhero movie. I recall an interview when the actor said a lot of Chinese people are called Bruce Lee. That makes the documentary ""The Problem With Apu"" even more idiotic. ***1/2.",positive
18,"With no real concept of the character or the story, I didn't really know what to expect from Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. I was pleasantly surprised. This Marvel action film is above average, and features impressive visuals, engaging action scenes, and entertaining characters. There are some missing pieces in the story, which they may be saving for later, but overall, I enjoyed this introduction to a new MCU superhero.",negative
19,"Daniel Destin Cretton created a tranquil really well filmed marvel story driven fun time! Simu Liu and a surprise character were the best along Awkwafina which is always delightful. I really appreciate the direction of everything especially the effects, action, cinematography, and the silliness is good! Might be odd or understandable this is one of the best marvel films.",positive
20,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch a new era of Marvel Studios rise with Shang-Chi, the master of Kung Fu. He has to face his past involving him with the Ten Rings organization and crate his future accordingly.I have to admit that I had my doubts about this movie but I was proven very wrong since it's an amazing movie. It has a beautiful and very interesting plot that keeps you in tense through its whole duration consisted of plenty of action and nice CGIs. For one more time Marvel succeeded on creating a nice atmosphere and connecting the previous movies with this one with many Easter Eggs so, we expect more in the near future. The interpretation of Simu Liu who played as Shaun / Shang-Chi was simply outstanding and he made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's who played as Xu Wenwu, Michelle Yeoh's who played as Ying Nan, Meng'er Zhang's who played as Xialing and Awkwafina's who played as Katy. The comic relief role of Ben Kingsley as Trevor Slattery was a brilliant idea that also gave something different in the movie. Finally, I have to say that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it, especially the fans of Marvel.",positive
21,"5 out of 5 stars.Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.",positive
22,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.Final Say -Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.4 chicken-pigs out of 5.",positive
23,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) :
Brief Review -Yet another superb stand-alone superhero flick in MCEU's kitty. MCEU's new phase never looked so promising but their products are delivering Better than expected. That Spider Man flick in 2019, right after Endgame, changed many perceptions about Marvel's future and even though couple of their recent series like 'Wanda Vision' and 'Loki' couldn't emerge as clear winners, they have set a solid base for upcoming new stories. Shang-Chi is a new start by all means. Not only because it comes under new phase but mainly because it is a stand-alone film and with a new superhero who is more like using traditional combat methods along with ancient superpowers. When Captain America or Black Panther begun as Stand-alone films, they promised too much and thankfully fulfilled it. Shang-Chi does the same. It may not promise too much like Steve Rogers and Wakanda stories but the point where it ends surely gives us hints of new assembled version of superheroes in Multiverse. Shang-Chi, the master of unarmed weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. The film has major portion covered by Family values and hence, it may look predictable but does not bore at all. Yes, few scenes are outdated and too dramatic as if we are watching a Superhero Film made in 90s but let's just forget those weak points as Shang Chi has excelled in Visual spectacle. The screenplay could have been better in the second half when the big War was supposed to take place but it actually looks tiny one except for those two humongous dragons which might remind you of 'The Hobbit'. Performances by Simu Li, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Florian Munteanu are fine according to less potential available for the roles. Actually, the humour and tone of these characters was great. They all looked normal people when they were not fighting and even though the film has ancient refrences, the character don't actually go too deep to become expressive. Director Destin Daniel Cretton seemed slightly off track in the beginning when he tries to humanise all the characters with that typically teenage humor but as the film goes ahead, he recovers from the childish entanglement. With super explosive climax he surely makes up for his mistakes, rather makes us forgive it. Overall, Shang Chi is another superb entertainer for Marvel Fanboys and even neutrals are gonna enjoy it.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",negative
24,"Action great (except cacophonous dragon fight), acting decent, visuals good, story predictable...the whole this is fine, but I have a more pressing matter to address here. I have yet to watch an MCU movie and felt like I got enough Wong. More Wong. Always more Wong.",negative
25,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.",positive
26,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings stars Simu Liu in the lead role alongside such heavy names as Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh in this latest installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Liu's Shang-Chi must come to his own as the son of the legendary Mandarin (Leung), the owner of the Ten Rings.I like this film's style most of all. Director Destin Daniel Cretton mixes Chinese wuxia settings and aesthetics with Hong Kong wire kung fu inspired action set pieces, while still keeping it feeling like a Marvel film. There's a surprising amount of callbacks and nods to the larger Marvel universe, pleasing dedicated fans, but the film is still able to stand on its own feet and introduce us to its hero.Kudos also to the whole filming for these action scenes. Very little shaky cam or jump cuts, especially for the hand to hand scenes. Exactly as it should be. I'd dare to say that this film has some of, if not the best action set pieces in all of MCU.One of the most thrilling and visually spectacular end battles as well, come to think of it.Furthermore, the acting is solid, especially from Liu, Leung and Awkwafina, who plays Shang-Chi's American friend. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing, Shang-Chi's younger sister, was perhaps my only real gripe with the film. I could have used either a bit more edge to her or alternatively a lot less. Now she seemed to flipflop between relatable and aggravating.All in all, not the best Marvel movie by any means, but that's a really high bar to clear. I can simply say that based on this, I'm very optimistic about MCU's continued future.",neutral
27,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fuIts a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.",negative
28,"Glad to see a marvel story that is not a continuation or a reboot. Shang Chi is a lesser known Marvel Character. It does reference that it is in the Marvel universe, but unlike Spider Man: Far from Home Shang Chi stands on it's own has a story.The actors all perform well, everybody plays off each other perfectly. The scenery is so visual, it becomes it's own character. Fight scenes are so intense and inventive. If you think it's another superhero origin story, well it is but at the same time it's not. I hope we see more new marvel films in the future.",negative
29,"Eluding his difficult past, a young man from China has been content playing it safe in San Francisco for the past several years even though he lacks a true sense of self. But when drastic circumstances draw him back to his conspicuous origins, he has no choice but to face his demons head on. Continuing to expand its cultural horizon the MCU's first Asian-centric movie has unique choreography, a dazzling visual scheme, splendid hand-to-hand combat, and of course the expected teases going forward, but some of the more elaborate action set pieces lack needed tension, much of the exposition and backstory isn't very engaging, and up until the third act many of the emotional aspects of the narrative aren't as rich or compelling as they could be. Some of the humor is strained, but it's efficiently cast and provides enough to be a distinctive entry into the Marvel world. **½",negative
30,"I saw ""Shang_Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", starring Simu Liu-Taken_tv, Kung Fu Cops; Awkwafina-Jumanji:The Next Level, Ocean's Eight; Tony Chiu_Wai Leung-The Grandmaster, Hard Boiled and Michelle Yeoh-Star Trek:Discovery_tv, Mechanic:Resurrection.This is the first Asian Marvel super hero movie that is based on a minor-not as well known-character. I grew up loving 'The Master of Kung Fu' because of the martial arts aspect and still have the original comic books. FYI: Shang_Chi was originally based-visually-on Bruce Lee. Paul Gulacy-one of the artist at the time-even drew Shang_Chi to look like Bruce Lee. They also made changes-mainly because of political correctness-to his origin story. Originally, Shang_Chi was the son of Fu Manchu, a racially insensitive character. But now, it has been changed to be the son of The Mandarin, an old Iron Man villain. In the comics, The Mandarin had 10 rings on his fingers but here it has been changed to rings on his forearms. These rings shoot energy force bolts and Tony also calls his evil organization, 'The Ten Rings'. Simu plays Shang_Chi and Tony is the Mandarin. In this origin story, you learn what caused their estrangement and why Tony is wanting so badly to reconnect. Awkwafina plays Simu's best friend that tags along on Simu's adventures with glimpses into his past & present life-and lots of fantastic martial arts-and Michelle play's Simu's aunt. If you like The Eagles, you'll probably enjoy the connection to 'Hotel California'. There are several cameos, including a couple of Avengers. As the end credits start, there is a scene and another one at the very end so don't leave too early.It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 12 minutes.I really enjoyed this movie and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",negative
31,". . . haven't we heard all of this before? China is infamous for intellectual property theft, with TEN RINGS being a sterling example of such nefarious cultural shoplifting. Seldom credited with any originality beyond propagating Germs of Mass Destruction, it would surprise no one if this outlaw band of grifters opened up a fast food restaurant chain tomorrow selling warm dogs and ""Chinese fries"" under some Silver Arches. Allegedly respectful of elder tradition, those on the Sinus Front have yet to realize that all that glitters is not gold. As Ms. Stein famously observed, ""A bus is a bus is a bus, no matter how you slice it.""",negative
32,"6/10 - I seem to be the only one to not be marveling at the latest Marvel Studios offering, but while this movie is technically sound (visual effects, stunt work, sound, cinematography, you name it), I found it to be mostly a rehash of things I've seen before (maybe I'm just getting tired of all these superhero movies)",negative
33,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021) is a movie my wife and I recently watched at the theatre. The storyline for this movie follows a young man and his best friend who work as parking attendants and are one day attacked by super villains. As they dig into the young man's past they discover his father is behind the attack with the purpose of hopefully brining his family back together. This movie is directed by Destin Daniel Cretton (Just Mercy) and stars Simu Liu (Blood and Water), Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (Infernal Affairs), Ben Kingsley (Iron Man 3), Michelle Yeoh (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and Awkwafina (Crazy Rich Asians). The storyline for this movie is way better than it should be and has crazy depth around all of the characters. You really understand the what, when and why behind every circumstance and perspective. The acting is outstanding and the characters are perfectly portrayed. The special effects are awesome both in terms of the action scenes and backdrops. The dragons may have been a bit overdone; but other than that, A++++. The choreography was also excellent and seeing Yeoh in this really made me smile. This movie is way better than it should be and is a worthwhile addition to the marvel universe. I'd strongly recommend it. I'd score this a solid 8/10.",positive
34,"Bringing martial arts into this franchise is well.... a breath of fresh air from Marvel. Showcasing a series of excellent action sequences. There are some very intelligent minds be hide this origin story fantasy sci-fi feature. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the best MCU films. Pro-tip, at some point in your lives seek this gem out ! This is going to be very solid UHD HDR blu-ray and the 3D is very impressive albeit some minor cross-talk but forgivable as the are some very intricate set pieces for the left and right eye to navigate via the post conversion 3D. Very well done over all.The visuals were absolutely stunning, comedic relief was always on point, fight sequences were sleek yet powerful. The story arch is well paced and unfolds gradually so one can get emotionally involved with the films characters , the acting is superb on all fronts from the films talented ensemble . The directing and pacing is spot on.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and one of my favorite entries as a whole. You'll leave the theater satisfied.",positive
35,"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.Main Character
Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.Supporting Characters
Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.Story
The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.Script
The script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.Style
The film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.Overall
Overall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi.",negative
36,"Car valet (Liu) and his friend are attacked by warriors working for his father who is a 1,000 year old owner of the 10 rings which gives him phenomenal powers. He and his sister are eventually captured by their father who reveals what his strange intentions are and how they fit in.Wonderful action packed fantasy adventure is brilliantly bought to life by a great cast and some great action sequences including some staggeringly beautiful fantasy scenes. Extraordinary how this almost child like fantasy film can so successfully bridge a chase scene across modern day San Francisco with battles with dragons whilst maintaining a goodly degree of drama snd humour. Huge fun.",positive
37,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.",negative

39,"The current MCU effort is truly a slight one as it swings for the fences to do what Black Panther did for all inclusive audiences by presenting an African superhero now we have a candidate, of the Asian persuasion, hoping for a repeat. Filling in the backstory of the rings (first introduced way back in the first Iron Man) which star Tony Leung has wielded for about 1000 years, which are a means of gaining power but when Leung wants to conquer a revered village in a remote forest, he meets his match & love which quells his desire to dominate fathering a pair of offspring (a boy & girl) as icing on the cake. Years later we find the scion, now played Simu Liu, living in the States working as a valet attendant w/his best friend, played by Awkwafina. When on a bus ride some men accost Lung for his jade pendant, his fighting prowess presents itself & fearing his sister is in similar straits (a cryptic postcard he received from her makes him think so), off he goes back to the bosom of Leung's fortress where he reveals their long dead mother may still be alive being held captive by the same residents of the Shangri-La he wanted to subjugate years before setting up a massive battle between Leung's forces & benevolent group of villagers who know the voice of Leung's wife is actually a captive dragon trickster hoping to be unleashed in order to feed on the souls of the nearby populace. So far so good, right? Wrong. Why did the usual craft & polish Disney's output come up short here? Lackluster lead, check, hackneyed story w/vague intimations of Asian legends & so forth, check (they do realize this comic book character was created by a couple of white guys!) & a third act replete w/motion & color to entice the viewers into thinking something more important is going on when the truth is, it isn't, check again. Didn't Disney fail to realize this was to be their third Asian inflected release in a year (after the live action Mulan remake & Raya & the Last Dragon animated feature, which also featured Awkwafina's vocal talents) so some of the story-lines would begin to cross pollinate & dilute each other until the final result would look like so much of a hodgepodge? I hate to be the dissenting opinion here but I would've rather have seen a big screen treatment of Iron Fist over this, apologies. Also starring Benedict Wong reprising his Wong character, Yuen Wah from Kung Fu Hustle as an archery elder, Michelle Yeoh as Liu's aunt & Zach Cherry (in his second incarnation in the MCU, he played the hot dog vendor who dares Spider-man to flip in Homecoming) here playing a bus passenger.",negative
40,"Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.My Rating: 8.6/10.",negative

If you've watched it, you know that the last 30 minutes AT LEAST, are simply MAGICAL! I just loved it, the portrayal of the comic story was really great, coming from a huge Marvel comic fan! Also, BEN THE LEGEND KINGSLEY!!!! Easily a 10/10, I can't wait for more material from this characters!Ps. The cameos in the end!",negative

43,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an incredible MCU origin story that's epic, emotional and extremely thrilling whilst also connecting to the greater universe in fun and satisfying ways. It's definitely the best thing in phase 4 so far even if it's third act has some of the usual MCU problems.Simu Liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with Awkwafina, who is also incredible. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang are both great and Tony Leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the MCU with plenty of backstory and depth.Destin Daniel Cretton's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and stylish with some of the best action sequences in the franchise. The fight choreography is extremely impressive and the CG is mostly strong. It's well paced and both the soundtrack and the music by Joel P. West are both fantastic.",positive
44,"The movie is pretty good in most ways, but Akwafina's character is just... annoying. Sorry I didn't like her in this.",negative
45,"LikesGreat Pacing:
Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.Character Development:
The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.The Surprise Cameo:
Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.The Cultural Influence:
Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.The CGI
Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.The Acting:
A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.The Comedy:
Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.The Action:
My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action exposé. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.A Bit More Adult:
The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.Some of the political moments:
While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.A Little More Action:The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.The VERDICT:Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5
Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.",negative
46,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters September 3, 2021. By Heather S., KIDS FIRST!",neutral
47,"Honestly, on all levels this movie excels! The casting is perfect. The world building is creative, beautiful and faithful to its Asian roots. The CGI and location shoots are breathtaking. The fighting is the best I've ever seen and even the training ground sequences have an exquisite grace. The action was balanced by heart. I was concerned Awkwafina would take the humour to campy lows but she truly showed she has some serious dramatic chops. She was not the comic relief! They gave that honour to the Shakespearean stage giant, Ben Kingsley, Our own, homegrown 🇨🇦 Simu Liu was perfect for the part and his performance was world class. I could go on raving but I'll conclude my feedback by saying that this is in every way as powerful a MCU solo representation of Asian culture as BLACK PANTHER was for African culture. I gathered some feedback as I left the theatre, and got ratings of 7.5 (felt it needed more MCU content), 8 (saw many of the things I have just commented on). I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design. Upon leaving the cinema, I was going to give the movie a 9 (superb) out of 10, but after reflecting on it, I don't know what they could have done to make it better, so, I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",negative
48,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (2021)Well what a pleasant surprise, very much in the style of Black Panther, this origin story was really great from start to finish.I saw this at the 3D 4DX at the O2 and we were thrown about, blown on, rained on and every other sensation at every turn it was fab-u-lus!We had some great acting some great humour and plenty of ""magic"", for Marvel fans after the lacklustre Black Widow, the disaster of the Winter Soldier. Two goodens in a row what with Snake Eyes!The fight scenes we well worked through and the opening bus sequence was very memorable. I don't thing there was anything I didn't like about this movie so I'm giving 10 outta 10.",negative
49,"Shang Chi is Marvel's latest blockbuster to grace the movies: and after 2020's non-existent Marvel slate, it was about bloody time we got something after the world dealt with the sars-variant and got our double shots. And now, late 2021 we can finally go back to the movies en masse, though the road to recovery's far from over.Shang Chi is part-origin-story for a character we've never known before, part-CG-spectacle interlaced with nice kung-fu choreography in between, all in-universe expansion for Marvel's cinematic ambitions. And it makes you wonder how deeply they thought about paying reverence to everything from Bruce Lee to the Matrix, to Dragon Ball, The Last Airbender and Kung Fu Panda.Marvel is doing its best to escape the confines of Iron Man's legacy, and this seems like an earnest start for something far-removed from the likes of Spider-Man, and so on. Also makes you wonder if Awkwafina is gonna become a major player outside the Shang Chi movies alone.Shang Chi is the stuff you've come to expect from Marvel Studios; it's going big and it won't stop with every subsequent film here onward. Though bigger and better seems better fitted for high-concept space operas like Infinity War and Endgame than more earthbound character-driven stories.Shang Chi's good fun, and it really succeeds in being that during its runtime.",negative

51,"Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.",negative
52,"As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge. That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together. Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary. I can't say that Shang-Chi will rise into the upper echelon of my MCU rankings, but it's better than some that came before.",negative
53,"Great fun King Fu fantasy movie with a bit of Marvel pizzazz and one liners thrown in.Really great fight sequences (the bus and the scaffold fights are terrific) and some really cool fantasy beasts and settings.I really enjoyed this ""diversity"" play more than Black Panther.

55,"The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it. There are a bunch of unneeded ""deux-ex machina"" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that's what happens when you get the 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"", ""WW84"" and ""The Expendables"" writers).Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst ""acting"" I've ever seen and a same type of joke (""awkward nonsense"") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.But...

The Marvel Cinematic Universe strikes gold yet again & can do no wrong! Director Destin Daniel Cretton has given us one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best origin stories. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. It's awesome to finally see the Kung Fu fighting style, utilized in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. Simu Liu is spectacular as Shaun/Shang-Chi. Liu easily balances the action, dramatic scenes & the Marvel Cinematic Universe's trademark humor. Can't wait to see more of him in the future. Awkwafina is hysterical as Katy. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is outstanding as Xu Wenwu. Meng'er Zhang is fantastic as Xialing. Fala Chen is brilliant as Li. Michelle Yeoh is excellent as Ying Nan. Florian Munteanu is superb as Razor Fist. The supporting cast is amazing. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans & superhero film buffs.

57,"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.Try to see SHANG-CHI on the Big Screen, the visuals are worth it.Letter Grade A- (the finale needed to be better)8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",negative

This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.The relationship built between Shaun and Katy is wonderful, and the actors deliver on it brilliantly: no wonder when you have the exceptional Awkwafina on the other end of it. Similarly, the relationship built between Shang-Chi and his father is powerful, thanks to some wonderful acting from Tony Chiu-Wai Leung. So good in the gripping (and erotic) 'Lust, Caution', I believe this is his first English-speaking film.With the odd exception (see below), the special effects are top-notch.Negatives:
I thought this was 5* all the way until the final reel, when we descended into a CGI-driven ""Godzilla vs Kong"" finale. I hate CGI that's just a blur of action across the screen where you're struggling to understand what's going on. Less would be more here for me.The movie makes extensive use of 'flashbacks' and, for me, there was a bit too much heavy-handedness in their use. I muttered ""enough already"" to a few of them, since they were taking us out of the movie's current narrative.There were a couple of effects that looked like the intern at the special effects company had put them together during a coffee break. An early plunge of a jeep into a forest and some rather obvious green-screen stuff in the finale. Surprised that these weren't caught and redone.Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.(For the full graphical review and video check out #onemannsmovies on the web, Facebook and Tiktok.

62,"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is now playing exclusively in theatres and if you're able to go in your area, I highly recommend it.",negative
63,"Shang-chi, the most disloyal man in MCU: he has 10 rings for 10 wives.Phase 4 continues with a new blockbuster with an all main Asian cast. Having escaped from his father, Shang-chi was forced to face his past and embrace his true self.Is this movie good? The answer should be no, despite how much people overhyped this. However, I did enjoy the fight choreography and beautiful visuals. This honestly doesn't mean a lot, considering that this is a Marvel's project. The cast did an okay job themselves, and some comedic moments land.If you actually take this movie seriously and don't get distracted by all the colors and actions on the screen, it should be clear that this was an overhyped, mediocre at best Marvel movie. It's not bad like Captain Marvel, but it's not good. There is barely any depth to the story. This type of story was done like a gazillion times, and this movie didn't add a lot into the tropes. The progression was formulaic, and you already know what the end would look like from the beginning.Our main character, Shang-chi, again, was typical and bland. The actor wasn't necessarily bad, it's just that the writers didn't try hard enough to make the character more compelling or special. Also, the dude just randomly knew how to crazy stuff near the end, despite never wear the ten rings himself before.Also, in typical Marvel fashion, the phenomenon of ""OH I know that person from somewhere else"" (*insert Leonardo DiCarpio's pointing meme*) was used as another distractor. Sometimes it's good and all, but remember that this made no impact on how good a movie is.Which directs your attention to the post-credit scenes. Again, another overhype train from people. Reality is: they aren't that special.Overall, just calm down people. A mediocre Marvel hero movie. Doesn't mean it's a bad movie. 6.5/10.",negative
64,"There are, of course, a lot of changes that had to be made between the comic book character and his Disney-fied counterpart. First and foremost being Shang-chi's paternal heritage! As Marvel no longer had licensing rights to the name ""Fu Manchu,"" the hero's villainous father had to be revised to being the true Mandarin (as opposed to Ben Kingsley's politically incorrect caricature as a terrorist group figurehead).Then, there's Shang-chi's sister. Instead of Fah Lo Suee (another literary character licensed to the Estate of Sax Rohmer), we have Xu Xialing. And, for Shang-Chi's girlfriend, we get American-born Katy. An original character who seems to be an amalgam of Leiko Wu and Misty Knight. Which only stands to reason, I suppose, as Shang-chi's maternal heritage seems to amalgamate his silver screen origin with the comic book origin of Iron Fist!Most important of all, however, is the emotional plausibility. Simu Liu provides that, for this version of Shang-Chi, the same way Tobey Maguire first brought believability to the cinematic Peter Parker.All in all? Not a bad way to transition from the end of summer into the next phase of Marvel Films.",negative
65,"I really had fun with this new Marvel movie, I didn't know who Shang-Chi was but I did my research on the character and went in on what I learned.Simu liu was awesome as Shang-Chi and played the character amazingly, Awkwafina was pretty funny and likable.The fight scenes and stunts were all really well choreographed and really cool seeing.I really liked the villain and the connection to the hero and the final fight. I found it amazing.Another great addition to the MCU.",positive
66,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU! Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist. Marvel gains yet another emotionally compelling antagonist, as well as a relatable female character that embodies many elements of the Asian-American culture. Despite an overreliance on unnecessary, excessive exposition devices (narration, flashbacks, foreshadowing), the story behind all the tales and legends never loses interest. From the breaking of stereotypes to a remarkable depiction of their culture, most Asian viewers will certainly love this film, even more than I do. Phase Four is off to a remarkable start...""Rating: A-",positive
67,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is the second film in Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Starring Simu Liu, Tony Leung, and Awkwafina, it elevates itself above the typical superhero origin story by incorporating many fantastic elements from Asian culture.In San Francisco, Shaun (Simu Liu) works as a parking valet along with his close friend Katy (Awkwafina). Unbeknownst to Katy, Shaun is hiding important secrets from her - he is in fact a skilled martial artist whose real name is Shang-Chi and he has run away from his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), the leader of the powerful Ten Rings organisation. After some Ten Rings members attack the pair of them on a bus, Shang-Chi discovers that they have stolen a valuable pendant given to him by his mother Li (Fala Chen) before he left for the United States. Shang-Chi grows concerned that the Ten Rings' next target will be the pendant belonging to his younger sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang), and so along with Katy he sets off to look for her before the gang can locate her first.Now that the Infinity Saga has concluded, the time has come for some new heroes to enter the MCU. Of course, there are so many to choose from, considering the large roster of characters that have come into existence over the last several decades. Although Shang-Chi wasn't the first one to come to my mind when predicting who would lead the charge of fresh faces into Phase Four, his debut big screen outing ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" successfully cements him as a memorable hero just as worthy as any other past Avenger.What I believe separates this film from the typical hero origin story is all of the interesting aspects of Asian culture it integrates into the story. I'm all for inclusivity in movies, so long as it isn't shoehorned in there for the sake of appeasing a political agenda, and here it succeeds greatly thanks to the wide array of Asian crew members who worked hard to ensure that virtually all customs are represented. The film never precisely establishes the place Shang-Chi's family is from (though it is hinted to be somewhere in mainland China), as they are seen observing various cultural traditions that don't quite narrow things down to one particular Asian country. For example, there are martial artists resembling Shaolin monks, who are supposed to be from China, seen using techniques from Japanese and Korean folklore. This has likely been done on purpose to ensure that all Asian audiences feel included, but never so much that it comes across as disrespectful. After previously bungling Asian-related matters with the terrible 2020 remake of ""Mulan"", ""Shang-Chi"" feels like an appropriate apology from Disney to all of their viewers.At this stage, it feels pointless to complain about Marvel films following the exact same template when introducing new heroes so I won't hold that against this one too much. With that said, thanks to some brilliantly choreographed martial arts fight scenes and gorgeous visuals, director Destin Daniel Cretton (""Just Mercy"") has provided us with one of the most unique looking MCU films to date. One scene near the beginning features Xu Wenwu walking through a bright, beautiful oriental garden complete with bamboo reeds in the foreground. A short time later, he is locked in hand-to-hand combat with his future love interest Li. This reminded me of ""wuxia"" films, a popular subgenre of Chinese martial arts movies, like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". In fact, this scene was such a good tribute to that genre that I almost forgot this was a Marvel movie and was instead watching one of those classic Kung Fu films my dad used to show me when I was young. You know you've created something special when your film can appeal this effectively to fans of both Marvel and Kung Fu movies.Considering the last thing I saw him in was the sitcom ""Kim's Convenience"", Simu Liu definitely took me by surprise as to how well cast he was as the film's main star. I was expecting him to be a wisecracking Americanised version of the Asian hero but he actually plays most of the film straight, only responding humorously when absolutely necessary. His dramatic side truly shines when he is interacting with his onscreen father Tony Leung. In fact, Leung's character Xu has one of the most tragic backstories of any character in the whole MCU, which I won't spoil here. Another surprise was Awkwafina as Shang-Chi's best friend Katy. Rather than being another typical love interest, Katy is instead a loyal platonic friend of his who is willing to help him out no matter how limited her knowledge on the field of battle may be. It also helps that she is responsible for most of the film's comic relief.With a new superhero now officially introduced, it's safe to assume that ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" has shown an optimistic future for the MCU. Its broad appeal to Eastern and Western audiences alike as well as the usual action-packed fun we've come to expect over the years makes it one of the best origin films to come out of the MCU to date. The Marvel hype train shows no signs of slowing down and if things keep going the way they are, it won't be stopping anytime soon.I rate it 8.5/10.",negative
68,"This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame. Finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the MCU to continue to entertain.The fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative. I wish they hadn't front-loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison. This film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the MCU with the Crouching Tiger-inspired hidden garden duel. There was a sense of more indie-based filmmaking and I really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre. I would be remiss not to mention Tony Leung, who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with.While there are still the tropes expected in a Marvel origin film, it succeeds pretty well for the most part. I wish the big CGI battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son, but alas. The humor, especially Awkwafina, was pretty hit or miss as well. The Trevor Slattery stuff was great though.Shang-Chi is definitely one of the best origin films in the MCU and really stands out as a unique entry in the long-running series.",negative
69,"Cool worlds/ten-rings VFX, OKayish plot, good characterisations.But somehow somewhere it felt like the film was actually made for kids maybe because of the story being wholly dependent on the magical dragon.Also, there could've been some heavy emotions & more action sequences & some twists/turns in the script to have more grip on the audience. Overall, it was a good watch but could've been still better.",negative
70,"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad.",negative
71,"What more do you want?I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan""",negative
72,"Shang - Chi is the new hero of the MCU and everyone is going to love him. Although I have a really deep criticism over fase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I've decided to go watch the movie in theaters (after two years of being away from theaters due to covid). Overall I really enjoyed it. There were still a few moments that I regretted and that were dull. Not to mention ""little mistakes"" that Marvel keep doing with their movies. In general it was a fun experience. The plot didn't have much to offer to be honest: another origin story of a superhero that tries to run away from his fate and responsibilities. Until he is forced to face his past.This has been the kind of way for Marvel to introduce their new characters in the MCU, I wished they would have been more creative but they do deliver creativity for once. Watching people speak their native language for once was a huge step up for Marvel. The movie is also influenced by many other asian classic films such as ""Hero"", ""Hidden Dragon"", ""Seven Samurai"" and ""In the mood for love"".Of course it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without some end credits scenes (how original). The end credit scene does confirm the return of Shang Chi at some point, but what the end credits scene does confirm moreover is how the future Marvel films will all get connected. As I said before, I'm less optimistic with this whole fase 4 of Marvel but it wouldn't hurt or kill to watch a few of them. To me, I just wanted to return to the theaters.Speaking of actors: Simu Liu is a fantastic actor and will definitely become a fan favorite, both him and his character. Awkwafina steals the show every single time she's on screen. Tony Leung is wonderful and acts so well. The whole cast is perfect. If you are in favor of theaters and Marvel movies than go watch Shang Chi.P. S: the end credit song - Fire in the Sky by Anderson Paak. Is the best part of the movie.",negative
73,"When i saw the trailer the movie looked awful.What surprised me in this movie is, its actually pretty funny.The first half was good the second half was okay.",positive
74,"Another great and entertaining experience which is very similar to what has gone before in format, but the formula works very well and I enjoyed the film a lot. The Asian style and presentation is beautiful, showing off plenty of folklore and style in both modern and traditional settings. The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting
The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more. The ending was pretty grand and epic, but I felt it could have been better.",positive
75,"The bus fight scene is one of the best action scenes of the entire MCU. Just for that scene alone, this movie deserves to be watched on the biggest screen possible. Shang Chi benefited from being a very unknown character and the movie gives him the opportunity to shine bright with his development. The story is really fast paced and even if the final act succumbs to the typical Marvel esque, it leaves you with a pretty solid good feeling while leaving the cinema. A really great MCU movie, a superb martial arts spectacle and a great step up for the Phase 4. Do not miss the two post credits scenes. The middle scene is exciting and the very last one is pretty intriguing. Bring it on, Marvel!",positive
76,"I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this. And on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!First instincts when watching were a little mixed. It was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go. And my first instincts on Katy were also mixed. I felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and I found her character really annoying. HOWEVER..Once it gets going the film gets better and better. Katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! For me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout.So is the plot good? To be blunt, yes! It's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways, I don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything, but it's really not what you expect. That's all I say!just an add on for this point. I will say there was a couple of points where it was quite obvious what was going to happen (ie when sister pops up for first time, you know exactly how about 10 mins before it happens). I think the final battle scene went on a bit longer than it needed to. But these are minor points that don't distract you or take anything away from the film itself.I'll shut up now! I'll just say it's well worth watching. It's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch. And overall it's a fun, visually pleasing and brilliant watch. I recommend.",negative
77,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had. It's easily the best Marvel movie post-Infinity Saga (I know, that's not exactly saying much), and is very promising for the quality of Marvel's next projects. We have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new, entertaining, and capable hero full of potential, in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways. The fight choreography was on point, the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance, the jokes all land, and the CGI is some of the best since Thanos himself. Shang-Chi is an all-out success for Marvel, it seems in multiple ways - both critically and financially. Really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about Shang-Chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the Ten Rings. Instead it's a Ten Rings movie featuring Shang-Chi, which is fine, but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the MCU. And yes, the Ten Rings are tied up with the Iron Man films perfectly, almost making the whole Aldrich Killian thing better in retrospect. I give Shang-Chi a high 8/10, with promise of moving up with rewatches.",negative
78,"""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you? You walked in my shadow.""Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn't seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There's much more to be made from him, but with future installments we'll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He's a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He's flawed, but there's depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I've been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can't wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she's also great. What they'll do with her next should be interesting.From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It's not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!",positive
79,"""Shang-Chi and the legend of The Ten Rings"" is a superhero origin story which seems more like a Chinese martial arts film than the next entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Many years ago I saw ""Crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" and found the fight scenes in that literally unbelievable a lot of the time. ""Shang-Chi"" often seems subtle in its fight scenes by comparison but then does have action sequences which are more like MCU superhero films. As an origin story, it assumes no familiarity with the MCU and in fact plays mostly as a non-MCU film, which is what I liked about it.Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi/Shaun, the son of a mobster, Xu Wenwu (played by Tony Leung) who could quite easily have been the subject of a film or franchise himself, due to his legendary characteristics. Shang-Chi's mother Ying Li (played by Fala Chen) is also a legendary kind of character. This contrast of 'Eastern' legendary figures and 'Western' MCU legendary figures worked to the former's advantage, as the latter often come across as plastic toy figurines being used in a sandpit by small boys to play with.The plot concerns how Shang-Chi/Shaun sought to move from under the shadow of his father to become his own man but just when he thought he was out, he is pulled back into Wenwu's orbit. The film mixes the seriousness, perhaps, of Chinese martial arts films with the jokey style of American Hollywood films. As should be expected from a MCU film, eventually the fate of the world will come into play and someone will have to play the hero to save it.The martial arts in this film juxtaposes frenetic fight sequences with elegant and fluid fight scenes which have their own particular charm. Other times the action sequences seem lifted from a Disney live action family film and that was enjoyable too, if you just suspended disbelief.Speaking of comedy, I found the earliest instance of this to be aiming very low for laughs, which isn't uncommon in MCU films but I warmed to later instances of it. For instance, I was amused by the character of a thespian who sounded like he was from Liverpool, when he reminisced about what he took from a film that he saw as a teenager and how that inspired him to get into acting. That actor playing the thespian did seem familiar, perhaps for his voice but I did recognise his name in the closing credits and remembered the role that he is perhaps best known for.An interesting aspect to this film is its subject matter, i.e. An Asian superhero and a mostly Asian cast. Is this another attempt by Hollywood to crack the now important Chinese market? If it is, then the cooling relations between the US and China is an unwelcome fly in the ointment for Hollywood studios trying to make a lot of money from Chinese cinemagoers.Another question that came into my mind was whether ""The Ten Rings"" is based on Chinese legend or is a Marvel appropriation of Chinese culture, tailored for 'Western' audiences that don't care about cultural authenticity. If it isn't the former, then I think that there could be a niche for films which mine authentic 'Eastern' legends and myths. That could be something which might interest me (Sinophiles would no doubt reel out a long list of films which have done just that!).As you might have guessed, I wasn't the first in line to see this film. In fact, I wasn't even sure that I wanted to see it, as I haven't watched every line of superhero films in the MCU (maybe I should watch ""The Black Panther""?). As it stands, I think it was worth the punt in seeing it. I'd go so far as to say that seeing a sequel to this would be more appealing if it wasn't tied to The Avengers franchise! Furthermore, I would have liked this film not to remind that it was part of the MCU, which it managed to do, at least until the closing credits, which I didn't welcome when it made its first appearance. With that being said, this is the kind of film that you could watch again, after a suitable break. Although I didn't watch this film in 3D, it might be worth it to do so (as sometimes the extra cost of the ticket gives added value to the experience and...sometimes it doesn't).Notes to self:* The narrative did have some logical gaps in it, for example why Shang-Chi was attacked on the bus. What was that all about?* The film was dedicated to the memory of Brad Allan, I think. Not sure who that was...searching now, a few websites list him as the supervising stunt coordinator.* Reading the closing credits, I was reminded that this film was shot in Australia, which isn't obvious watching it, so, good job studio (I think I saw or heard something on ABC in Australia about how Asian Australians got to be in this film, perhaps a kung fu exponent or exponents)!* My score for this film was tracking from 75% (7 out of 10 stars) to 75+% (8 out 10 stars) to just a flat 80% final score.",negative
80,"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.Yet again Marvel Studios knocking it out of the park!",negative
81,"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.",positive
82,Best superhero movie ever made. Shang Chi was epic on every level.,positive
83,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that.",negative
84,"Marvel's latest feature introduces cinephiles to Shaun AKA Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) a martial arts master and a character created by Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin, first appearing in a Marvel publication back in 1973. Beginning in the first of many gorgeously choreographed and shot sequences, we're introduced to Shang-Chi's father Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) and mother Li (Fala Chen) also entailing the awesome power of the Ten Rings which Xu currently has in his possession. What follows is a heart-pounding and ridiculously entertaining adventure movie with true heart.Filled with beautiful performances not least from everyone already mentioned and including Awkwafina as Shaun's best friends Katy and Meng'er Zhang as sister Xialing, there's plenty here to adore on screen not even getting to the truly awe-inspiring action set pieces with the best fight scenes I've seen in recent memory. Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) is very quickly becoming one of my favourite directors having produced three incredible pieces of cinema in the last 8 years. It's great to see that his passion for storytelling and independent spirit still shines through his latest here while also staying true to the Marvel fan base (I really did not expect a certain character to show up but made for some really comical moments).The visual effects are of course stunning but what makes them stand out here are how they're incorporated with the beautiful landscapes to enhance the feeling of authentically experiencing Shaun's heritage and getting wrapped up in the culture that the filmmakers so wonderfully explore. This is how origin stories should be made! The creature design is also incredible and is an integral element to making the final sequences all the more breathtaking.Please do yourselves a favour and see this on the biggest screens possible, please support your local cinema and stay safe my friends.",positive
85,"One again the studio brings jokes and the dazzling visuals over a good character development. After one hour, you don't care for the characters. Dysfunctional drama in the family and the chosen one - we have seen this a million times.This is the first time I felt sleepy for an action movie. I feel like i wasted my money, despite availing the Super Tuesday offer. The Suicide Squad was far much better in terms of storyboard.Over-rated, like Black Panther

86,"Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings
2021
12A
director: Destin Daniel Cretton
starring: Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Ben Kingsley, Tony Leung, Meng'er Zhang, Fala Chen, Michelle Yeoh, Wah Yeun, Florian Munteanu etcShang Chi (Simu Liu) the master of unarmed weaponry-based kung fu. Is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the ten rings organisation. Wow what a film Shang Chi was and one of the strongest additions to the MCU.My first few positives would be the character background and set up. As well as the fantastic cinematography, worldbuilding and action. As well as the likeable characters and performances. I really liked that the film went into the character background for the Mandarin and the mythology of the ten rings and how he got them, with an action packed and well explained opening sequence that set the tone for the film very well, offering something different from the MCU from the very first scene. I also thought the set up was strong, the film established Shang Chi and his life without his dad excellently, making you connect to the characters, but also did a great job at setting up the villain's intentions well and developing the plot nicely. The cinematography in this film had to be some of the most beautiful visuals I have seen from the MCU. There were so many beautifully shot scenes especially within the action scenes with mid or long shots where you could actually see what was happening. The colour grading and scope of the film was seriously impressive, I was in awe. I also thought the action was probably the strongest I have seen from the MCU. The action was incredibly choreographed, very entertaining, and incorporated Asian culture and kung fu and they were so well shot it was one of the films strongest elements. The worldbuilding was also very strong. This film introduced us to such a rich and beautiful new world, it was beautiful and well explained and really explored in a lot of detail but left more to be explored for the future. This film was like seeing Wakanda for the first time. The film had such likeable characters. Particularly with Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) all of the new characters introduced were instantly likeable and I connected with them quickly. This was also helped by the fantastic Chemistry between the whole cast, everyone worked amazing together, especially Simu Liu and Awkwafina who were both amazing here, and did amazing performances. They both had loads of charm and charisma. Other cast standouts were Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh and Menger Zhang.My next few positives would be the humour and sound design. The family dynamic and character depth. As well as the fun cameos and Plot twists. The soundtrack for the film was also excellent, it gave the action scenes in particular an intense atmosphere and really elevated a lot of the scenes well. I really liked the family dynamic the film had. Having the villain be Shang Chi's father and his mother and sister be involved was a great idea. It made the film more personal to the characters and increased the stakes for the characters, they had a connection and the conflict between the different members of the family was very well written. This gave characters like Shang Chi and the Mandarin a lot more character depth. The mandarin was so crushed by his wife's death because she made him a good man, and his quest to find his wife really gave him some emotional depth, and Shang Chi's attempt to live a normal life and escape his father's shadow, but also look for his dads love and acceptance was really well handled, as well as his character decisions involving his sister and his regret over his mother gave his character a good amount of layers. The cameos in this film were a lot of fun, there was a few easter eggs sprinkled throughout but it still felt like its own film. But having Wong back was a great surprise and that was in the trailer so not a spoiler. I also thought the plot twists were strong. The twists involving the family's secrets and the new world were well executed, unexpected and added some great layers to the film, it never once got boring.I did have a few minor issues. The villain was underused going into the final act, there was a few issues with the creative decisions in the final act. And there was a slight overusage of flashbacks. I did find that the mandarin was taken out of a big chunk of the film in order to delay the final act and expand the story world more, it would have been nice for his character to be incorporated within the plot as a whole instead of being used for more flashbacks. I did find that there were too many flashbacks. A lot of them served the plot well and had purpose, but some of them felt unneeded and repetitive and were occasionally jarring. There were just a few creative decisions in the final act I wasn't fond of. There was some overusage of CGI that took me out of a couple of scenes, and there was a deux ex Machina with Katy that was slightly cheesy to me.My final few positives would be the set pieces. Great development to the plot and balance to the villain. As well as interesting elements, great dialogue, and a great final act. The films set locations were beautiful, they really captured the magic of the world as well as Asian culture, the representation for the Asian community in this film was excellent. The plot development was also excellent, the twists gave the film multiple layers to work with, and the different acts flowed well, with constant new elements being added to keep the film feeling fresh. I also thought the film did an excellent job at making the audience sympathise with the Mandarin but also making it clear he was still the villain, as the film showed what kind of man he used to be with his wife I understood him wanting to be reunited with her, but the film excellently balanced this with his cruel and controlling behaviour to make him one of the strongest villains I have seen in a while in the MCU. I also thought there was a lot of interesting elements to the story world. The world of Ta lo was fascinating, and the film went into great detail of the culture and the lives of the people living there which was fascinating. The dialogue was also great, raising great themes of acceptance, family and grief that was excellently told through the lines of dialogue that felt personal to the characters and were very well written. The final act was also amazing. They went all out with the visuals and action. In a thrilling, exciting and breath-taking final act that conclude the story and the character arcs excellently and setting up Chang Chi's future in the MCU very well.Overall, Shang Chi has a few structure issues and falls into some MCU tropes with the CGI in the final act. But this film was visually stunning, with some of the best worldbuilding and action from the MCU. With star making performances from Simu Liu and Awkwafina. Also, with amazing Asian representation. This has really taken the MCU in a different direction and is one of their strongest origin stories.Overall rating 92/100.",positive
87,"'Shang-Chi & the Legend of the Ten Rings' (or SCLTR?) feels like the proper start of MCU's phase 4, with a clear link forming to 'Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness'. We're first introduced to what seems like a Chinese fairytale, as we follow Wenwu (Leung) and his millennium of power with 10 enchanted rings/bracelets. We then meet Li (Chen), who turns out to be the mum of Shang-Chi (Liu) & Xialing (Zhang).How the mystical realm of Ta Lo fits in and it's secrets aren't revealed until the third act, and after the intro, the film does well to show Shang-Chi & Katy (Awkwafina) living their somewhat unfulfilled lives in San Francisco, before the action starts to heat up when Shang-Chi goes looking for his sister. All the actors are very likeable, especially Leung, who does a great job of making sure Wenwu doesn't descend into a caricature of a bad guy, but truly feels like a misguided father. Some great cameos also round everything out and it's always great to see Michelle Yeoh.While a bit slow in some parts, the martial arts scenes and action near the end are great, without being overwhelming - certainly up there with 'Hero' & 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. Also a nice nod to 'Raya & the Last Dragon'! Nice ending and character arc for Shang-Chi - I look forward to seeing him find his place in the MCU.",positive
88,"After being burned by Mulan last year, I went into this film with very low expectations, but was delighted to find this movie was wonderful to watch. Tony Leung, as the misguided villain trying to resurrect his wife and Shaun's mother, is the breakout star here, and his storyline - along with Leung's acting - is so magnificent that it sort of overshadows the other characters, including Shaun. This film is exciting, yet also heartwarming.",negative
89,Without a doubt the best action sequences in a marvel film and the best action scenes too. One of the best marvel films also. A great story and great acting. Loved this film.,positive
90,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pokémon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting. Meng'er Zhang does not get that much time in the film, but a bit less good or present in the film.",positive
91,Good entertaining and Bollywood like. It is loaded with action. Preferably watch on the biggest screen available.,positive
92,"Let's agree that it is a bad movie from multiple points of view. It depends a lot on the visual effects, its main characters can be funny but not nice, the story does not generate much interest and we have seen the fights many times and in a better way in almost any film produced in Hong Kong, Indonesia or Thailand of the last twenty years. The only thing that saves this film is the karaoke scene that is unexpectedly welcome. The rest is routine, mediocre, tiring and bland.",negative
93,"I thought this film was a good break from the usual marvel super hero films, it was much more traditional martial arts film combined with some modern aspects.The concept was good and the film went along at a great pace. There was some good humour as well.I would really recommend it.",positive
94,"When the movie first started... I felt like I was watching a ""foreign"" film. No English just Chinese with English subtitle? Didn't know what to expect in this movie. Then later on, the casts started speaking English & the awesome fighting scenes kicked in. OMG!! How exciting~ The fighting choreography was unbelievable. Just as good as Jackie Chan movies!The storyline was alright but the CG was very good. They used lots of Chinese culture tradition, costume & symbols. Looking forward to see the next sequel.",negative
95,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" follows the same formula that's presented to audiences in any typical Marvel film; with that said, ""Shang-Chi"" gives you exactly what you expect, for better or for worse. There are no tricks up this movie's sleeve - there are no surprises. This film delivers a standard, well-executed superhero film, and whether or not you enjoy that will be completely up to you.I, for one, am sick of the standard Marvel setup; I admit I have superhero fatigue, and unfortunately, ""Shang-Chi"" follows that typical superhero setup to a T - what that means is an extremely bland film both in character and plot, with only a few sparks of light along that tease a more compelling movie. The best parts of ""Shang-Chi"" involve Tony Chiu-Wai Leung; he plays a surprisingly complex and sympathetic villain and stars in some scenes that echoed the badassery of Asian gangster flicks. One scene where he takes out a room full of villains was so intense that I wish the movie would've followed that plot line instead of the subpar narrative we were left with. So, yes, Tony is great - everything else in ""Shang-Chi"" is mediocre, including the titular hero.Iron-Man. Spider-Man. Black Widow. The Hulk. Dr. Strange. These are all Marvel superheroes that you can immediately picture because of their distinctiveness as characters. Black Widow is the sexy, badass assassin. Spider-Man is the naive but pure hearted schoolboy. Iron-Man is the cocky billionaire. Shang-Chi? He's the, um, actually, who is he? That's exactly what you'll be asking yourself because Shang-Chi barely has a personality in this film - his character is so dull and forgettable. And me saying that is in no way a slight to Simu Liu, because he's fine in the role; it's the script that does him no favors. When it comes to other characters, Awkwafina was in this movie, and I honestly was excited to see her in this because of how good she was in ""The Farewell."" And wow, my excitement was led astray because she was about as fun and entertaining as a prostate exam. I mean, sweet Jesus, she was so grating that I considered stuffing popcorn into my ears so I didn't have to listen to her speak anymore. Her jokes weren't funny, her dialogue was awful (I'm sure most of it was improvised), and her character was just plain annoying.""Shang-Chi"" was also a very boring film, stuffed with poor dialogue and loads of exposition that had me nodding off in the theatre. A lot of lines were so cheesy, and so poorly delivered, that I found myself rolling my eyes. ""Shang-Chi"" also has the same amount of bland, uncreative editing and filming that is present in a lot of Marvel films - characters walk from room to room, and talk about this subject and that subject. It's not fun, it's not entertaining, and let's face it, it's horrendously boring. But okay, you're willing to look past that if the action is good, I get it! So how was the action?The first act of this movie does have two good action sequences, and you've seen them both in the trailer - the bus fight, and the scaffolding fight. I hope you're not that big a fan of Kung-Fu, because after those two fights, you will no longer get well-choreographed action and will instead be treated to horrific CGI battles. I'm talking ring-on-ring action and unnecessary giant monster fights that had no place or purpose in this movie. And it's all boring to watch. I mean, you have basically the first ever Kung-Fu superhero movie, and you decide to only include two scenes of Kung-Fu? What were the creators thinking?""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was an exercise in disappointment. Instead of attempting to do something different, the film does exactly what you'd expect. And hey, if you love these kind of movies, you'll most likely love this film, and that's great - I hope you do. But if you're at all tired by the exact same formula that all superhero movies follow, ""Shang-Chi"" won't manage to lull you out of your superhero fatigue.",negative
96,"It's good action movie. Firstly, the scenario is pretty good, but it has nothing special, it's a little bit predictable. Secondly, the cast is awesome, I really like Akwafina in her role, she is very funny. Also I like Simu Lu as main character he is charismatic person. But my favourite is one character from past film of MCU (don't want to give spoiler). Thirdly, I like how the atmosphere of ancient Chinese culture was shown, but for me I want more. Fourthly, the fighting is good too.So, it's nice MCU film.",neutral
97,"Marvel has supplied their fans with a fast, fresh and funny superhero adventure with unconditionally perfect amounts of exhilarating action and fascinating characters. The enthusiasm noticeably kicks off with sustainable writing, in which an appealing plot is arranged and the excellent protagonists are propped. Secondly, director Destin Daniel Cretton recieves the role of brilliantly executing the visually-awakening tale.There's no doubt that the real magic belongs to the epic sequences of fantastical action. With stylish martial arts battles and superb effects, Shang-Chi's epic movie lives up to both the hype and its genre. However, there are some ridiculous and unnecessary details. It's also significant to announce the fact that the amount of action is perfect! There's not too much to the point where it's tedious and not too less to the point where all that can be remembered is the dialogue.Marvel flicks usually include several moments of bland dialogue between the superheroes. It occasionally grows fairly unexciting, but most of it is surprisingly gripping and the entertaining adventure rules over it. Alongside the massively-praised action is humour and heart-pumping credits scenes.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",neutral
98,"As with all Marvel movies, the ending tries so hard to be enormous that it becomes visually impossible to comprehend. I would like it if just one of these superhero movies had a character think and talk their way out of a threat to humanity. Nevertheless, this is one of the better attempts... Primarily because it is a well acted origin story with a minimal amount of heart and soul. Be thankful for small mercies!",positive
99,"Let me preface this by saying that my enjoyment of the movie may have been dampered by a poor night's sleep. That being said, the middle 45 minutes of this film had me nearly falling asleep, literally. The character development just couldn't hook me at all because it felt like they kept revisiting the same points.On a positive note, the visuals and martial arts are absolutely spectacular. The first act of the film contains most of the martial arts and it is so crisp and well-choreographed. The final act flexes all of the CGI dollas and they make they already big budget stretch far, with some of the more impressive sights you will see in a Marvel movie so far. This movie didn't quite hit the 8/10 for me to recommend people see it in theatres, but lets tack that up to me being tired and you go see it anyway!",negative
100,"Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show. Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel, and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon.To be honest I have started to give up. Marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years, but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that, by now, boring Marvel feel. Marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness, more feminism, and more nonsense diversity, and it has all failed.This movie however is not a failure.Why?This movie is simple, it is to the point, it follows tropes, cliches, and it is a classic heroes journey - which is exactly why it works!Marvel took a classical story we all heard, read and seen before but they switched a few things around, kept some of that Marvel feel, and made it play out mainly in China and almost only with Chinese actors. And it works!Imagine that? Sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough, but who cares when you have great fight scenes, lovely sceneries, a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters.We even get a villain that you understand, sympathise with and even feel a sting of ""ah, too bad"" about him.This is how you make an action movie! Great stuff Marvel!The points I deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing. They pull the heroes journey of sure, but we have also seen it done better. Sound is great, but not amazing, directing is great, but not amazing, etc. Etc. Everything about this movie is high class, greatly done, and well performed, but it is not on top, it is not amazing nor perfect.I also have a few objections about the background story and the ending, but I am keeping this spoiler free so...8/10. This is a great movie and highly entertaining, and definitely worth the ticket price. Go see and get your faith in Marvel restored.",negative
101,"Let me commence by saying this movie is by far one of the most-fun, action packed Marvel movies ever!Simu Liu is the perfect Marvel protagonist, and Awkwafina delivers the obligatory yet welcomed dose of humor you'd come to expect from a Marvel presentation.But beyond that this movie is rich with mythology, adventure, and incredible martial arts combat that cannot be described with another phrase other than breathtaking, to be the introduction of a new character the story is well-written and you feel as if he had been with us from the start,I give this move the 10 it deserves, In Marvel We Trust.",neutral
102,"Ok, so I really liked it. In particular I really liked the characters. I loved the hero's journey that Shang Chi went on. I loved his relationship with Katy and his sister. They were all likable, and badass in their own way. And you could empathize with them. I thought this was a very strong villain. Not just physically, but very compelling. A lot of MCU villains can come across as very one note. But he was complex and layered. So that was great to see. And of course they were all strongly acted as well. Akwafina is maybe the least strongest out of the main cast (Check out The Farewell if you really want to see her shine) but like, she is still is good in this.I loved the fight choreography in this. Probably some of the best fight scenes you get in the MCU. And I loved the visuals used in those scenes as well. Some shots were truly stunning to watch.One downside I had though is that I wanted to know more about how the magic works. Like the final battle between Shang Chi and his father he has suddenly mastered his mother's magic/fighting. And I know the movie kind of pokes fun of this at the end by having Shang Chi tell his friends that he had 1 day of training. But seriously, how did that happen? Is it just because he's his mother's son? Is it because he was specifically in that place? I just needed a little more backstory/explanation. Also, the Wong/Abomination fight (which was totally spoiled in the trailers) didnt really do anything and just added more questions. I guess they needed a way to set up Wong for the mid credits scene though. And that mid credits scene in general just raised more questions for me. Like why is Bruce back to being in his human form? It clearly takes place after the events of Endgame (judging by his arm sling) so why is he not in his Professor Hulk form?I thought the comedy was good for the most part. I think it worked well with the beginning and ending of the film. But didnt always land during the more meatier parts of the film. Theres maybe a few other elements I could nitpick but for the most part I really liked this film. Im not sure where I would rank it yet. I think probably a top 10-er.",negative
103,"I'm not someone who is a fan of action movies. I'm really not. But even here, there's no denying the action sequences are brilliantly executed and have a lot more of a hit than most of the marvel movies out there.Although Simu Liu falters a little bit as a leading man, he has a truly impressive cast to support him. Awkwafina is brilliantly funny and quippy as she always is. And Tony Leung, the complex antagonist and the hero's father, has the most depth in this film.The visual effects are beyond beautiful. They reminded me of Ferngully, and the nature I observed as a child. Good stuff!There are some surprising cameos that are both hilarious and wholesome.It was so good to see it in Imax after such a long cinema hiatus. Definitely check this one out!",negative
104,"After a disappointing Marvel entry with Black Widow, Shang-Chi is the return to form movie Marvel needed to bounce back off on. With solid performances, great setpieces, fun action sequences, and some emotional depth and humour to it, it's the type of film you need to see on the big screen and just go along with the journey and fantastical elements. It's also paced well and intriguing for the runtime it has.The direction is solid and the characters get a good amount of screen time each to develop and have well placed flashback sequences. The martial arts fights are pretty well done and the CGI creatures look interesting with their designs and have good special effects. Overall, it's very well done and I didn't think Marvel could keep going, but they proved they can still make great stuff when they care about it.8/10.",positive
105,"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'Small Tiger' among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong CinemaThe flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin's world of violence and carnage.The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange's world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology.As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.It is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product.Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.Highly recommended. A must watch. Marvel's Phase 4 continues to raise the bar!",positive
106,"Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future. I literally know nothing about this character but I found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted, effectively character-driven, occasionally funny, rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action. It has what I hoped I was going to get from Black Panther: inclusivity AND an interesting world and narrative. I'm 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced, too and I just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating.Although Shang-Chi treads the familiar origin story formula, there's a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character's journey apart from the others. Though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast-paced yet slightly derivative set-pieces in urban environments, the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me). The Chinese philosophy kicks in, the mythology is abundant, there's tons of visually striking imagery, a fantastical setting, loads of insane action choreography. The Asian representation is just off the chain and I was so enraptured by it. It doesn't feel contrived, I sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding. A nice balance. I was very satisfied with what I saw. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi's world and how it'll tie in with other stories yet-to-come. Very cool movie. Soulful, cultural and action-packed.",negative
107,"I was really looking forward to this film, and was excited to see shang chi in the MCU. It started out good with an interesting father, and son character development. As the film continued, it seemed to rely very heavily on the CGI. After a while all the CGI felt bloated and overwhelming. The acting was well done, by everyone in the film no weak links. Was hoping this film, would have had a more grounded plot like Iron Man.",positive
108,"There is an instant thrill in having a supersized Marvel superhero movie begin with a voiceover in Mandarin as Tony Leung comes into the frame. One of the world's great actors, Leung exerts an effortless majesty. In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, he plays Wenwu - an immortal who possesses 10 rings with enormous occult power. Wenwu, also known as The Mandarin, heads a criminal organisation called The Ten Rings, which was introduced in the first Iron Man movie. He is a man tormented by an insatiable lust for power, which somehow gets submerged under his love for his wife but then resurfaces after her death as something even more twisted and vicious. Wenwu is one of the more tragic villains in the MCU and Leung plays him with a melancholic charisma that doesn't let up even in the climax as several CGI creatures twist and snarl and prey on everything in their path. He is one of the many pleasures of this film.Read the full review on Film Companion.",positive
109,"Wow! Another Marvel film. YaY! I'm not sure what I watched, but I know I've seen it at least 50 times before. Boring and cliche Superhero Plot, cheesy dialogue, dull acting. Been There, Seen That Special Effects.I'm not sure when Disney is going to figure out how to make good films again. But when ones like this continue to rake in cash at the box office, we'll be inundated with them forever. And that's the real shame.",negative
110,"Twelve year old me loved this movie. It is big, bold, colourful, action packed, fun, funny, and has flying dragons. Cranky codger me says no to flying dragons. Sorry to any preteens peeking in (highly unlikely), flying dragons are a silly figment of someone's imagination. A movie with flying dragons is difficult to take seriously. Sorry kids. There is also some shocking news about Santa Clause, but let's save that for another day.The good news here: Marvel again steps up to the plate in their inclusivity transformation of what movie making can and should be. They also manage to keep the rest of their superhero Universe from ruining what is a pretty good martial arts film by inserting the briefest of brief Marvel cameos to keep the all important story arc threaded. As usual for the studio, the supporting cast is pretty sweet. Ben Kingsley with a Ringo accent absolutely slays. Ronnie Chieng in a brief but outrageous cameo absolutely slays. Awkwafina in a major cameo absolutely slays. Tony Leung as the dark father and ring master absolutely slays, slays a lot.The bad news: let's face facts, it may not be possible to make a good martial arts movie. Just when things get interesting we get a fight sequence where combatants, while absorbing what should be lethal blows, magically fly backwards unscathed. Zero gravity time baby! Why is this a thing? Used to be done with wires, so very obvious, and oddly enough, even with CGI at the ready, we still get that bizarre old school wire look. Homage has its limits. And lastly and most sadly the rousing cast of secondary characters pretty well squeezes Simu Liu into a not so main character role. Kinda forgettable if truth be told. That's a problem. A big problem.The really cool highlights in ""Shang-Chi"", like the morphing forest maze, are a series of disconnected sequences that seem parachuted in, not integral to the story. As is often the case in the Marvel Universe, someone in the art department went a little crazy. With ""Black Panther"" it was the robot rhinos, and here it is a bizarre shimmering, sequinned horse hybrid (a hornless unicorn, so a nocorn?). Oh and then there are the cute furry, winged animals (get ready for the Xmas plush toy stampede) who somehow survive without any orifices. No really: nothing goes in, nothing goes out, and yet it survives, and also communicates!Shame about all these niggling details, but they do ruin what could be a grand cinematic experience, an epic of epic proportions, though relentlessly formulaic, a family affair that nicks Shakespearian conflict, culminating with volcanic battle scenes of archery, catapults, swords, and uh, oh yeah, flying dragons.The Marvel Universe is making strides, especially with the dark and moody ""Black Widow"", and the hilariously over the top, potty-mouthed ""Deadpool"". ""Shang-Chi"" is a heroic stray away from the usual masked heroes in tights genre, but it just needs less than more. A lot less. Chop chop.Twelve year olds rejoice!hipCRANK.",negative
111,"The action and camera work in particular, along with the cast were very impressive! What I didn't like about it though were just a couple of throw-away nuisance characters and some of the weird humor. Other than that, I'd say it's worth a watch! Plus, it was good seeing some old Marvel faces!",neutral
112,"The first film in the MCU's next phase was BLACK WIDOW, but that film, which featured Scarlet Johannson's swan song as the title character, felt very much like it was grounded in what had come before, but SHANG-CHI: THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS very much breaks new ground, and takes us into a heretofore only hinted at corner of the Marvel Universe. It's the origin story of the title character, a martial arts superhero, but he is not nearly as well known as Spider-Man or Captain America, so we are not treated to yet another iteration of Uncle Ben's demise. Instead we are given a fleshed out story of a tragic family, one without easily defined villains. Shang-Chi joined the Marvel Comic scene in 1973 in an attempt to create a character that could cash in on the Kung Fu craze at the height of Bruce Lee's popularity. He had his own book for many years, interacting with other Marvel heroes, and if he has not been a Marvel regular in recent decades, Shang-Chi has never gone away, and retained the loyalty of many hardcore fans.Like all origin movies, SHANG-CHI begins with some exposition and back story, specifically concerning his father, Wenwu, played by Tone Leung, a power hungry thousand year old immortal, who wields the Ten Rings of the title, a fearsome mystical weapon of an unknown source. Only when he meets Li, played by Fala Chen, a fighter from the hidden realm of Ta-Lo, does he find someone who is his equal in combat. Falling in love, Wenwu forsakes his violent ways, and starts a family with Li. But in every hero's origin story there must be a tragedy, and when Li is murdered by Wenwu's rivals, he seeks vengeance, becoming the villain he once was, and teaching his son and daughter how to become deadly assassins. When we meet Shang-Chi, well played by Simu Liu, he is a twenty something Chinese immigrant living in San Francisco making a living as a parking valet with his best friend/girlfriend, Katy, played by Awkwafina, having broken from his father's world. But as with most stories centering on estranged families, the plot turns on them being drawn back together, and Wenwu needs a pair of pendants belonging to Shang-Chi and his sister that were gifts from their mother because they are essential, he believes, if he is to free his deceased spouse from the Dark Realm, whose entrance lies inside Ta-Lo. And if Shang-Chi doesn't want to go along with Dad's plan, too bad. It all comes to a head in an epic battle in Ta-Lo in a CGI heavy third act - pretty much a staple for the MCU.I liked this movie because it has plenty of energy, with great well done action scenes, along with some spectacularly staged martial arts battles. It also has a lot of heart, with characters who are easy to become invested in. And this lighter touch is welcome after the dark turns of AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR. In Tony Leung, it has a great villain with an understandable motive, something essential with any good super hero film. Simu Liu is an appealing lead, and he's matched all the way by Awkwafina's Katy, an underachiever who discovers special skills. I am not always impressed with CGI laden film making, but I don't mind it here because I actually care about the all too human characters involved in the action. The finale in Ta-Lo is supposed to be the high point of the movie, but for me, nothing beats the battle on the careening city bus on the streets of San Francisco early in the film, where Shang-Chi first shows his true martial arts prowess against his father's minions, led by the fearsome Razor Fist, played by the physically impressive Florian Monteneau. Michelle Yeoh has a part as a village elder, and out of nowhere, Ben Kingsley returns as actor Trevor Slattery, thus redeeming what for many of us fans what was one of the more disappointing villain tweaks from IRON MAN 3.An early scene at a Hong Kong fight club firmly establishes that all this is happening in the MCU with appearances by Benedict Wong's character from DOCTOR STRANGE, and the Abomination from THE HULK. Wong returns in a post credits scene that clearly sets up Shang-Chi and Katy for the big leagues in the next phase of the MCU. Will they learn where the Ten Rings came from, and maybe does THE ETERNALS have anything to do with it? And there is the dangling plot thread of what exactly happened when Shang-Chi was sent to kill the man responsible for his mother's death when he was 14; it was the event that estranged him from his father. Something tells me we will find out in some future installment. I can hardly wait.",negative
113,"A very welcomed addition to the MCU, and any Avengers to come. 'Shang-Chi' kung-fu's it's way to top tier MCU territory, especially when it comes to origin stories.Perhaps this generations 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', both of which are visual spectacles to behold. 'Shang-Chi' is full of beautiful creatures, costumes, martial arts, and acting. Probably the best fighting in the MCU, which makes sense (though Cap and Winter Soldier fighting is my personal favourite). The real Mandarin makes his debut and does not disappoint, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung was fantastic. All the other cast members were very likable as well. A few appearances from other MCU characters, including a surprising one that somewhat redeems himself.A refreshing Marvel superhero movie in that it primarily focuses on itself, but has tons of potential to jump right in with other Marvel storylines. The MCU still holds lots of excitement for the future with characters like Shang-Chi.",negative
114,"For nearly ten years after its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was dominated by the adventures of white men. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had to fight to get her own film this year, while her male co-stars got entire trilogies . ""Black Panther"" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of African culture in 2018, proving that the Marvel brand didn't have to be so beige. ""Captain Marvel"" became the first MCU film to be fronted by a woman. Now, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" marks the first Asian-led film. Not only does the film feature the first Asian protagonist, it also features a predominantly Asian cast and crew, which, thankfully, give this franchise a much needed change in perspective.The Ten Rings have been around for nearly a thousand years, gifting their wearer, Wenwu, immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength. After centuries of building an empire out of blood, Wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical land of Ta Lo. When heartbreak struck shortly after, Wenwu picked up the rings once again, causing him to go down a dark path, and his son, Shang-Chi, to run away to the United States. Now after ten years, the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be.Similar to what Ryan Coogler was able to do with ""Black Panther"", co-writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition. His use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal, especially as the film reaches its climax, but they're used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture.Without a leading acting credit to his name, Simu Liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero's journey with charm and composure. Mixing a bit of T'Challa with Tony Stark, Shang-Chi is a hero battling with his past and future. Liu and Cretton strike a great balance as Liu hands himself over to Cretton's material in the somber moments, and Cretton lets Liu's comedic instincts light up the room.Veteran Tony Leung brings the same melancholic energy to Wenwu as he did in his roles with Wong Kar-wai, particularly his work in ""In the Mood for Love."" Leung layers this villain and distances him from the average world dominator. He carries a stillness about him that inspires fear and compassion, two things that have made some of the greatest villains.The overall narrative within a Marvel film is evenly composed of the plot and the action. Thankfully, Cretton blends both those halves together as he imbues the setpieces with the qualities of the wuxia genre, taking after such films as Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (also starring Michelle Yeoh) and Zhang Yimou's ""House of Flying Daggers."" The action often tells as much of the story as the dialogue, particularly in the gracefully dazzling opening sequence. But there's also room for brutality as the first act ends with a tower-scaffolding brawl where Shang-Chi's emotions turn him into a raw killer. Not since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has the action been so impactful on a technical and emotional level.When allowed to be its own film, ""Shang-Chi"" is quite the spectacle. But when it gets forcefully molded into a Marvel film, the results are less than stellar. Even after all his work with the story and action, Cretton can't break free from the third-act visual effects extravaganza that holds this franchise like an iron vice. It's a shame as the smaller familial moments do more for the mind and soul than the forgettable litany of explosions that encompass the final thirty minutes. Being that this is the 25th film in the franchise, I've come to expect that level of disappointment.Thanks to its multi-talented cast and crew, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the better origin stories within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action may (rightfully) be the selling point, but the heart of the film lies within its characters, telling a familiar story on an impressive scale.",negative
115,"This was a good movie,1. Even though my wife and I don't usually like this genre, we enjoyed this one.2. Nora Lum stole the movie. Look for her in future films.3. The prettiest actress in the film was Fela Chen, even though she played the mother. Also ;ook for her in future films.",negative
116,"POSITIVES:1) The villain is one of the strongest of the MCU in my opinion. Shang's relationship with his father is very complex and multi dimensional and I was very engaged by him as a villain - threatening but relatable
2) The first half of the film is fantastic - everything up until Shang is reunited with his father. The hand to hand combat scenes in this first half of the film are excellent and I was very engaged by the story during this period as well
3) The cinematography and direction were very good, there was definitely a certain sense of style to the way the film was shot. The hand to hand combat scenes for example are often shot with long takes and a swirling camera and it was a very high quality of camerawork in my opinionNEGATIVES:1) As is typical with Marvel, there is lots of attempted humour and there is lots of it that doesn't work
2) The idea that Katy has never picked up a bow and arrow in her life but then goes on to save the day with it was just outrageous and took me out of the film. They clearly felt like they had to give her something to do but it was a bad decision to do that
3) The film severely falls away in the second act in my opinion. It goes from a relatively grounded film about family, where all the fight scenes are hand to hand, to a film about a giant soul eating dragon that is going to destroy the entire universe. The second half of the film is what made me have to lower my grade because I was sitting at a 9 after the end of the first half.",negative
117,"The charm of this movie comes from the setting of the main characters, showing a reflection of today's world, where Asian culture and the way of life in the west creates an environment of searching for one's own identity and place - this is where we meet Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) first. A young adult trying to navigate through his life far away from his family in the city of San Francisco. His partner in crime is his best female friend Katy (Awkwafina).Simu Liu's character arc in this film is not significant. Although he makes
a solid protagonist, his own character development is de minimis. Awkwafina, by contrast, steals the film as the ordinary person caught up in the epic power struggle. Her trademark zingers and bemused quips make her the perfect foil against the escapist superhero world that she- and we as the audience- are thrust into. Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) is a subtly effective Marvel villain with a compelling family backstory; he is a cinematic antagonist with the most idealism and righteous sense of purpose since Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"".Michelle Yeoh as Shang-Chi's aunt Jiang Nan has again some great fighting scenes which stand up to her wonderful performance in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Overall this movie has great fighting scenes, extraordinary effects, especially the flying dragons which are delightful to watch. Highly recommended for everyone who likes superheroes and a touch of mysterious fairytales.",positive
118,"It's always fun to go to the theater for a new MCU production -- a chance to see something **new** that you know will be well produced and will keep on stretching their shared universe of superheros. With Shang-Chi it looks like their Phase 4 is well and truly launched, and you can already glimpse what Marvel Studios' overall approach is going to be. (More below.)Just like Black Widow was Marvel's run at doing a James Bond-type film, Shang-Chi is their try at doing the Chinese martial arts thing. The result is a kind of compromise Westernized version that falls between two poles. For sure though, you'll be entertained. There's more than enough action, a lot of strikingly beautiful settings, and fun characters. But before I forget -- the mid-credits scene is one of the best they've ever done and totally worth staying for. (That's where the quote I put in the title above comes from -- a certain familiar character telling Shang-Chi to sure, come on in and join the craziness.) It does the usual thing of tossing the baton forward to whatever the next production will be, but it's stylistically so clever that it really stands out.And the film itself: it fills up its 2:12 runtime with a whole lot of material and a lot of characters. Maybe too much. The third act in particular veers off onto a fantasy-type track that doesn't entirely fit well with the previous hour and a half of setup, and the scenes in that last section suddenly feel more rushed. Gone are the days of the first Iron Man or Thor or Ant-Man movies with their lean, linear storylines and single well defined themes. Instead, Marvel now seems to want to overstuff every one of their productions, even if they involve 'secondary' MCU characters, and turn them into epics. More and bigger is not always better, is it?I did like the cast. Marvel always does an impressive job bringing in good people. Nice to see there are no less than 4 (!) major roles for females, as opposed to 2 for males, and they mix and match well. Of the mostly young cast though, I thought the older pair (Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh) really stood out -- they effortlessly dominate the screen when they are on. Leung's character could have been a stock, one-dimensional scenery-chewing villain, but he's much more nuanced than that. Simu Liu (the lead role, Shang-Chi) is not exactly a great actor just yet, but he's athletic and cute and attractive with a sense of humor and for this role he doesn't need to be much more than that. Awkwafina, as Katy, does her usual turn with comic relief and side commentary with a dash of romance. As for Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) -- that came out of nowhere and he's absolutely out of place, but somehow it works partly because of his pet that rises to Disney levels of cuteness.About Phase 4. The first three cycles introduced and used particular major characters that were all required to fit under the Avengers umbrella. Now it's the post-Avengers era and from their scheduled series of releases up through 2023, we'll see a much more diverse slate of characters and stories that don't obviously fall under a single umbrella. If they do have a Master Plan for something equivalent to the Avengers, it's hard to see what it is. Maybe, they'll use this new freedom just to show us interesting stories in a bigger universe.",positive
119,"Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a great Marvel Studios film. The story was fun and engaging, and was surprisingly emotional, with Shang Chi's relationship with his father and sister. The father's death was surprisingly impactful, and which the movie did well. One issue with the story was that the film would take a pause with the plot for flashbacks and exposition. They do make the film boring and slow at times, but there's not many. Plus, the flashbacks can be helpful
The visuals and action scenes in this film are, in my opinion, some of the best action scenes in the MCU. The film takes advantage of the martial arts action to deliver epic fight scenes. The visuals were also stellar. The CGI was top notch, and the backgrounds were some of the best from Marvel.The Characters were all fun to watch, and throughout the movie, you feel engaged in these characters. Shang Chi and Katy's chemistry is great. The villain was a great antagonist in this film. Some characters were bland and forgettable, but the good ones shine the most throughout the film.Overall, it's a great MCU film with a compelling story, great fights and visuals, and engaging characters. IT can be a bit slow at times, but the film is a must watch. MY favorite MCU film since Far From Home.",positive

121,"'Black Widow' may have been the first Marvel Cinematic Universe film to hit theaters following the recommencement of major films debuting in theaters after the COVID 19 pandemic numbers dropped, however, 'Shang-Chi' is the true start of the next wave of MCU development. All of the original characters, minus Thor, have been retired from service by death or other means so new blood is required via new superheroes and new origin stories, and given the current state of affairs look for a much more diverse flavor of super-hero going forward. 'Shang-Chi' marks the first step on that path with the first true Asian super-hero to hit the big screen starring Simu Liu in the title role who is originally from China although his parents immigrated to Canada when he was only five. The actors and characters here are almost entirely Asian lending credibility to the character and the plot. Co-stars include Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung.Thousands of years ago Xu Wenwu discovers these ten magical rings which he can wear to give him great power and immortality. He wields them through the centuries to collect power. In 1996 he journeys to the hidden entrance of a village known as Ta Lo to accumulate more power. He meets a woman, Ying Li, guarding the entrance and she is able to match him in a martial arts fight. He leaves but returns and eventually love sprouts between the two. For a time he sets aside the rings and power and starts a family resulting in two children but when Ying Li dies he reverts to his old ways and raises his kids under his authoritarian rule within his Ten Rings criminal organization. He raises son Shang-Chi to be a warrior, but Shang flees, leaving his sister, and starts a new life in San Francisco. There he exists as a normal guy with job as a car valet. He is kind of an underperforming slacker, but seems happy with where he is. His best friend is Katy played by Awkwafina. One day Shang-Chi is attacked on a bus and his medallion is stolen and he knows his father has found him. This launches him and Katy on a quest to find his sister and foil his father's nefarious plans before he destroys the mythical town where his mother is from by unleashing some kind of hellspawn demon into the world.While 'Shang-Chi' is raking in rave reviews my response is a bit more measured. I think this is a solid origin story and introduces a dynamic new character that could prove to be a vital part of this next phase of the MCU. I think Simu Liu is well cast as is Awkwafina as his best friend/sidekick, but I thought overall the film was better than average rather than the superlative, next level action hero blockbuster I was expecting. First I feel that the film is derivative in its plot a bit. Some of this comes from the fact that I just saw 'Raya and the Last Dragon' and this feels a lot like that movie. They both even feature Awkwafina and 'Shang-Chi' even has a dragon in final climactic battle sequence. I thought it was clever, but also clearly revisionist history to have Ben Kingsley's much maligned Trevor (aka The Mandarin), from 'Iron Man 3' make an appearance. That was clearly designed to undo the plot misstep that was utilizing The Mandarin and the Ten Rings in that film as a sham terrorist organization. I very much enjoyed all the martial arts action and the fights were very well filmed and choreographed. The actual ten rings of power that eventually get passed to Shang-Chi by the end felt like a bit of one trick pony. They were kind of cool and clearly powerful, but the artifact's power set remained a bit unclear and their use while visually stimulating seemed very cartoonish at times. I am not sure how to rectify the look of the ten rings when employed, but I was hoping for better on that front. I was also perplexed a bit by the clear takeover of the Ten Rings organization by Shang's sister at the film's close which seems designed to lead to a larger plot in a different film, but that move also is very reminiscent of what Sharon Carter is doing over in the Disney Plus MCU shows.Most of the time I found myself asking the larger MCU questions rather than enjoying this film. This came in the form of the appearance of Wong and Emil Blonsky (aka Abomination) in an underground fighting ring in Macau run by Shang-Chi's sister. Why are this two disparate MCU supporting characters there and also why do they appear to be in allegiance as one is a hero and the other a villain? The other MCU connections come in the post credit scenes where Wong pulls hastily minted super-heroes, and possibly new Avengers, Shang and Katy, into his Sanctum Santorum for a powwow with Captain Marvel and Bruce Banner regarding the ten rings artifact which are emitting a mysterious signal. The most important piece of all this would seem to be the glaring absence of Doctor Strange.There is a lot of good stuff to take away from 'Shang-Chi'. The film is full of some new and dynamic characters. Marvel needs these characters to catch fire if they are going to build this next phase of the MCU into something that can culminate in an 'Infinity War/Endgame' level event. This is a good story, even if a tad derivative, and it is filmed and executed well. It has some prototypical MCU style humor, mainly due to Awkwafina, but the humor is more low key than a lot of other MCU films. The well choreographed fight scenes are about the best thing here. They are fun and intense and really take me back to boyhood trying to absorb as many martial arts movies as I could. This is a solid entry, especially as an origin story, into the MCU. I liked the film and the character of Shang-Chi. It remains to be seen how he will be integrated, going forward, into the larger cinematic universe.Eric's Grade: B.",negative

124,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the latest comic-book inspired action-fantasy film from Marvel-Disney Studios. Daniel Destin Crettin is the director.The film stars Simu Liu (Canadian television's ""Kim's Convenience"") as the title character. Known as Shaun in the beginning of the narrative, he's a late-20-something who works as a valet at a San Francisco hotel with his carefree best friend Katy (Nora ""Awkwafina"" Lum). Seemingly okay with eking by earning a working-class living, Shaun's life changes when he receives a mysterious postcard. The next day a group of hitmen attack him on a bus, forcing him to reveal his potent martial arts prowess.Turns out, ""Shaun"" was born to Wenwu (veteran Chinese cinema star Tony Leung), a crime boss in China whose career has literally lasted centuries, thanks to a mysterious set of rings worn around his lower arms that grant magic powers-- including, apparently, immortality. Shang Chi's mother Ying Li (Fala Chen) was a resident of a mysterious, magical Chinese city-- think Shangri-La or Black Panther's Wakanda. Possessing her own magic-inspired martial arts skills, she convinced Wenwu to temporarily leave behind his crime empire and start a family. It didn't last, leading to a family tragedy and Shang's self-imposed exile in America.The plot has to do with Wenwu's insistence on bringing Shang and his sister Xialing (Menger Zhang) back into the family fold, so they can collectively find the entrance to the mystic city, conquer the inhabitants and reunite with Ying Li, who Wenwu insists whispers to him from beyond the grave. Shang and Xialing want nothing to do with their father's criminal empire, but Wenwu is not above brutality to convince cooperation.The film takes dramatic liberties with the original source material. Part of this is legally necessary, as the comic book Shang Chi's father was originally Yellow Peril villain Fu Manchu-- officially owned by the Sax Rohmer estate. Additionally, the original comics posed Shang as an agent of Great Britain's MI-6, with a mostly British supporting cast, including someone who ""playfully"" would refer to Shang as (an ethnic slur for Chinese/Asians). All of that backdrop is wisely eschewed for an all new set of allies and adversaries. Katy provides comic relief and as a low-key audience stand-in. As a 2nd-generation child of immigrants she also highlights the vantage point of someone who is very ""Americanized"" who bristles at ""old school values and customs"" of her parents/grandparents but striggles to fulfill her own pathway in life.Simu Liu gives a solid journeyman's performance as Shang Chi. He handles the action as well as the dramatic and comedic components. Still, it's something of a role that's semi-mired in exposition, because viewers mainly get to see his younger life in flashbacks.The action is well choreographed, including ballet-like scenes of combat and courtship alike, with nods to fantasy physics but never egregiously outlandish. The film also has beautiful cinematography courtesy of Bill Pope (his cinematography credits include 'The Matrix' and the first three 'Spider-Man' films).Possibly the most fully realized performance is that of Tony Leung, who gets to portray a more in-depth villain than is typically featured in most comic book movies. There are other solid supporting roles played by Michelle Yeoh and Sir Ben Kingsley.The climax of the film is filled with special-effects-based wonders including creatures of all sorts and Mulan-style fights between army legions. This can get dizzying for the non-comics-steeped layperson, so this may be overwhelming for some viewers. But the overall narrative is satisfying.The film takes place independent of any particular goings-in in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it is only a post-credits coda that links it to the greater Marvel pantheon. This film can be enjoyed by itself without watching any of the ""Avengers"" franchises.It remains to be seen whether ""Legend of the Ten Rings"" makes the Shang Chi character a household name alongside Captain America, Iron Man and the Rest but it is more than a worthy entry to the current phase of the Marvel movie saga.",neutral

126,"Shang-Chi is a character I and many others, know very little about. Which in Marvels case offers up a clean slate to tell a fresh story. I'm happy to say they have delivered. Marvel's newest outing is a Kung-Fu superhero extravaganza, that is fully built on it's action and set pieces. The performances of Simu Liu and Tony Leung stand out amongst the pack and offer a great and rich story for Marvels Cinematic Universe. Though the film can at times feel bogged down by its origin story tropes, the direction of Destin Daniel Cretton, the overall charm of its cast, and story make the film feel fresh and lively. I'm happy to welcome this crew to the ever growing MCU and cannot wait to see what comes next. Hopefully more Shang-Chi!",positive
127,"Crouch, you tiger! Hide, you dragon! Wax on and wax off, and fight, fight, fight!The title is as annoyingly long as the movie itself, which itself is an exercise in some ho-hum and perfunctory dotting of Is and crossing of Ts. As we wade into the shallow waters of whatever the next batch of uninspired Marvel movies present to our collective global faces, it becomes increasingly difficult to feel that old sense of joy and inspiration moviegoers used to call Movie Magic, maybe because everything is oh-so-magical all the time, a crisp and bloated 132 minutes worth.It seems almost impossible to reveal any spoilers for a movie such as this, where the plot could fit on a business card printed in a large font, something like: ""Hero shows off, struggles midway, then overcomes substantial adversity to win once again."" Will there be any sequels? Will Shang-Chi become part of the greater Marvel Cashcowiverse? Will Disney buy up other intellectual properties and make more of the same type thing?It should not feel like work when one goes to a show, and it is completely acceptable to check one's brain at the door, but these movies are becoming absolutely tedious, ponderous, even. Ponderous.",negative
128,Top 5 greatest marvel movies ever made. The choreography of the fights are beautiful. The cgi is beautiful the story is beautiful. Just watch it.,positive
129,"This is yet another film that I appreciate more than I actually like it. I'm really glad this movie exists and we have more diverse characters in the MCU. The Film nails Shang-Chi. Simu Liu gives a great performance and while his motivation isn't exactly clear, his character is and I like that. It's good to see that the origin movie does a great job at giving us a somewhat compelling character that I am looking forward to seeing more of. However, all of the other characters aren't anywhere close to being as good. The performances from most everyone is good with Tony Leung giving a great performance. His villain isn't great character wise but what I really adored was his villain's motivation. We finally get a true villain who is motivated by grief and the inability to accept the loss of a loved one. I love that about him and it's refreshing to see that. The story here is very weak. I didn't engage with it that much and it was hard to understand the motivations of anyone except the villain. The plot progresses quickly but it's hard to remember individual story beats because it kinda melds into some of the other MCU films. One thing that does stand out are the visuals and some of the action sequences. Some of the action sequences here were great like the final battle while others felt lackluster. It's a mixed bag in regards to that. As always, the visuals for this film are great for the most part. There is the occasional weird visual effect but it doesn't get absolutely horrible. The production design was surprisingly great here. All of the sets look really cool and it's obvious they spent a lot of time on that. There really isn't a lot more to say. On one hand, there are a lot if great things here but in the other, it feels like a standard Marvel movie. I would recommend checking it out if you are still into the MCU.",positive
130,"Effectively an origin story for Shang-Chi that marries the styles of superhero and martial art films wonderfully, and adds some much needed intrigue back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).I did legitimately enjoy the movie! It tries new things and is one of the more enjoyable MCU films. However, it did not quote tip the scale into becoming one of the best MCU movies in my opinion. At times, it felt a little too fantastical for my liking (especially the third act).The story, visuals, and characters are all pretty great! But I find the film mostly suffered from an ending that could have been more grounded in reality than it was. I am happy though, to see Shang-Chi added into the MCU.",positive
131,"The very first question to be asked would be, ""Why was this movie even made in the first place?"" It's one of those ones that tries to be too much and ultimately fails at everything. It starts off as a love story, then turns into ""Filthy Rich Asians,"" and then ends as a conventional action pic. A romantic feminist vibe is terribly present throughout the entire picture, which wouldn't be that bad if that was all it was about. But this movie has trouble settling on one single narrative. It's almost like an asian version of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" As is typical of this current generation of filmmaking, it's just another ""People running around doing things"" movie. The market is just saturated with these SFX garbage movies which this summer was full of!!",positive
132,Another amazing Marvel film with awesome visual effects. I think they did a great job blending Asian culture within film. Give me more second-tier Marvel characters.,positive
133,"Wow was this fun. Charismatic Simu hits a home run/touchdown with this movie. Even Akwafina becomes likable by the halfway point and that's saying a lot. Unlike recent martial arts movies like Black Widow or Snake Eyes you actually see the punches and kicks. Even the wire fu looks elegant instead of ridiculous. Something very few movies have pulled off. Funny, fun and never boring despite quite a bit of exposition and the final CGI extravaganza battle is a sight to behold. Fantastic battle between the Chineese dragon and the malevolent creature. After seeing 5 disappointing back to back superhero movies:
Far from Home
Harley Quinn
WW2
Black Widow
Suicide Squad
They finally made one that's better than all those put together. Don't get me started on the utter trash that Joker was. Finally one worth seeing. Hats off to all involved.",positive
134,"After the Mulan remake, it was safe to say that I was thoroughly disappointed, the portrayal of Chinese culture, even in the mystical sense, just felt like a disaster. But this one, oh this one was so much better. I was actually impressed. It felt like it was actually catered to a different market this time. While someone unfamiliar with Chinese culture may find it to be 'just another Marvel movie(albeit an amazing one), to those who know, you will be treated to something that has been basically non existent in Hollywood films, aka inside jokes/depth of knowledge that really helps elevate the film to a whole nother level.",negative
135,"Shang - Chi had some great elements. The Martial Arts, Choreography, and a few Easter eggs. The bad is when their is forced humor in a serious moment.The few best details was the characters you were familiar with in the other MCU movies. Wong, Abomination, and Trevor the fake Mandarin from Iron Man 3. I love these great surprises.The Martial Arts were also great. It felt more of a Rush Hour and Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon feel to it.The movie had a family element to it. Tragic for Shang-Chi but when things get serious, and why does the studio want forced humor? We do not need Karaoke. But they make it a joke.In the end, I enjoyed it but I don't think it the best MCU movie ever compare to Avengers Infinity War and Endgame.",negative
136,"Yeah this is a really enjoyable film. Is it anything that unique or incredible...kind of. The action definitely is. The action is by far the greatest part of the movie, damn does it look sick. The choreography is excellent, the fighting is so fluid, it's so fast paced and carries momentum throughout. All that is due to the vfx which are ofc good for such a high budget film. Now where I think the movie messed up a bit was the villain. The villain isn't bad per say but is just really bland and unoriginal, it actually gets really predictable towards the end. Also the ending is just absolutely crazy. Now don't get me wrong crazy is absolutely great for an over the top movie like this but it did take me out of the movie. The first section of the movie tho! AMAZING! The middle chunk...meh and the final mehWOWmeh. The soundtrack is good. The side characters are stale. And the comedy is actually surprisingly good, but sometimes misplaced into serious scenes. That's about it...it's...it's good!",negative
137,"Usual Marvel origin movie would be :
Predictable story (check)
Sarcastic tone with awesome punchlines(check)
Ending with hyping for next movie(check)
It checked all necessary boxes on top of that the martial arts and awesome fast paced plot and CGI packed with Stunning Visuals and awesome Score and that post credits was like cherry on top!It's a coolest Marvel's superhero origin Yet!",positive
138,"Seamlessly combined modern martial arts fantasy and Asian mythology without cringe/dull moments made it a different kind of MCU movies to entertain international audience.Mind few (back and forth) narrative problems, Destin Daniel Cretton successfully put humor and heart in right time and places.Thanks to scintillating cast who lit up the screen especially charismatic Tony Leung.Chemistry between Simu & Awkwafina as besties are undeniably good.Action scenes including CGI works definitely made some nice highlights.Going to watch it over and over again, IMAX gave better experience for sure 😁",positive
139,"This movie was great, it was entertaining, it was fast paced, and it was unique. There were so many things I liked about this film. First off, I loved all the characters, such as Shang-Chi, Katy, Xu Wenwu, Xialing, Razor Fist, Death Dealer, the return of Trevor Slattery, Morris, and of course Master Guang Bo. The actors for all these characters were also perfect. They suited their roles perfectly. In my opinion, this movie had some of the best supporting characters in the MCU. I also loved the action. It was absolutely amazing, there were some points in the movie where I felt like I was watching a martial arts movie. The stunts and the choreography were perfect, I couldn't have asked for anything more. The effects in this movie were also stunning. The moving forest, the mythical creatures (especially the dragon), and the effects used on the Ten Rings were super cool. The effects in this movie were some of the best in the MCU. Lastly, I also loved the plot, it just sat really well with me.This movie was like nothing we have ever seen before in the MCU. It was very unique and a nice twist for Marvel. The first Credit Scene was also very interesting and might have set up phase 4 in the MCU. This was a great movie, and I definitely recommend going to see it, even if you aren't a Marvel fan.",positive
140,One of the most beautiful Marvel films as of yet. On top of that are the visual effects and the fight scenes top level. It will be interessting to see how Shang-Chi will fit in the MCU and whem we will see him next. And btw Wong is a legend. But yeah I should probably go now...ooor...,positive
141,"It was hard to believe that Destin Daniel Cretton directed this film, which is a complete contrast from his previous work. Tony Leung Chiu Wai was the only reason to watch this movie if you aren't a sucker for superhero movies. Shang Chi proves Scorcese's point on Marvel movies despite being surprisingly entertaining.It was good to see a major blockbuster from a non-USA centric point of view. Shang Chi's best movements are it's timed humour and martial arts fight scenes. The ending of the movie is a theme park ride with eye soaring VFX of two dragons which are supposedy fighting but we don't know it due to excess use of colour.On the whole Shang Chi is a typical summer blockbuster which is bound to entertain all demographics but it's linear storyline and under utilisation of Tony Leung Chiu Wai's talent is a bit underwhelming.",negative
142,"Masaki Kobayashi was a pacifist. The celebrated Japanese filmmaker, best-known for ""The Human Condition"", took the unusual and daring position of denouncing his country's military actions during WWII. Somehow, Kobayashi got ""The Thick-Walled Room"" financed, and pushed it past the censors, even though it broached the largely taboo subject of war crimes. Set in an American detention center, war veterans express guilt and remorse, and most importantly, hold themselves accountable for their actions. ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", directed by Dustin Daniel Cretton, is evocative of Kobayashi's ideology circumlocutorily by referencing ""Kwaidan"", in particular, ""The Woman of the Snow"", the second in a quartet of ghost stories, which was the filmmaker's only foray into genre; the horror movie. Xu Wenwen(Tony Leung), aka ""The Mandarin"", a warmonger blessed with everlasting life, learns the whereabouts of Ta Lo, a village secreted away behind thick foliage. It's people know how to fight like gods. Surviving the ambulatory trees that claim the Xu's discovery party, he encounters Li(Fala Chen), the divine martial arts' most experienced practitioner, his future wife, in what can only be described as a grindhouse meet-cute. Whereas The Mandarin harnesses his power through the ten rings, Li only needs her bare hands to win the battle with relative ease. Without the ten rings(nunchucks being its closest analogue), The Mandarin is no Bruce Lee, whose hands they say, as the legend goes, were unregistered lethal weapons. Inexplicably, Li falls in love with this psychopath, whose penchant for violence rivals The Joker.From ""Kwaidan"", for starters, the filmmaker, having the advantage of CGI in his tool kit, draws out the plant life's malevolent subtext, in which its lunging movement towards the two woodcutters, caught in a terrible snowstorm, seems not only a condition of the wild winds, but an innate cognition to do them bodily harm. The trees are sitting ducks. The trees can't defend themselves from the woodcutters' axes. They're lives are dependent on the Woman of the Snow, a glacial apparition whose arctic breath entombs men in ice. The ""Yuki-Onna""(Keiko Kishi) blows on Mosaku(Jun Hamamura), one of the woodcutters, as he sleeps in an abandoned hut. It's a superpower that any villain in the Marvel universe would regard with a modicum of awe. The surviving woodcutter witnesses the older man's killing and expects the same ignominious end-result. But when the woman gets a closer look at Minokichi(Tatsuya Nakadai), she is smitten, indicated by an elusive smile, and ends up citing his handsomeness and youth as reasons for her charity. Clearly, the woman of the snow is lonely, her Achilles heel; the ultimate cougar, who must be at least a thousand-plus years his senior. In ""Shang Chi"", it's more clear-cut that Li is abdicating her duty to defend Ta Lo from potential marauders, choosing personal happiness over communal obligation. Harder to glean, but not too hard, Yuki-Onna also has deep-seated commitments. A sort of Mother Nature, but militant, her job is to fend off those who wish to shorten the lives of flora and fauna; she's a warrior for the natural world. Trees will fell unchallenged by the axes of future woodcutters, similar to how the Tai Lo villagers die in war waged by Wen-Wu and his army. Each respective woman chose love over duty; a domestic life, husband and children, over their calling.To both Shang Chi(Simu Liu) and Xialing(Meng-er Zhang), son and daughter, Li bequeaths her sired ones a green emerald pendant that even through adulthood, never leave their necks; these precious gemstones handed down from their deceased mother, refashioned into bling. Green, coincidence or not, is the same color as the crystal which guides young Clark Kent(Jeff East) to the farthest reaches of the north, in Richard Lester's ""Superman"", where the Krypton-based jewel initiates construction on the Fortress of Solitude, Superman's man cave. Both women, Li and Yuki-Onna inhabited fortress solitudes of their own, a village cut off from mainland China and rural Japan, respectively. Even Superman chooses Lois Lane(Margot Kidder) over being earth's champion, when he exposes himself to the red sunlight of his home planet, which strips him of his superpowers. Nobody wants to be alone, not even the Man of Steel. Quite understandably, Li, being a responsible custodian, leaves her magic back in Tai Lo, not even trusting her husband with god-level Kung Fu. The ten rings, on the other hand, could be put to good use, but reappropriating the weapon into a tool to protect mankind isn't in his nature. All he can do is store them away in a desk drawer, neutralizing its awesome power, in the interim. The Mandarin could be a potential superhero, but his reformation is conditional; it's contingent on romantic love, not brotherly love. There are limits to love. He can only be a retired foe to earth, not its friend. Because of this, Li keeps secret from her husband the purport of those emeralds, which are actually emblematic eyes of a mechanized statue, not mere heirlooms passed down from parent to child, in which its niche as performative dragon eyes radiate water held in suspension long enough to yield a map that directs The Mandarin to Tai Lo. The mother played no favorites, whereas Jor-El(Marlon Brando) provided no duplicate green crystal for Kara(Helen Slater), Superman's female cousin, in Jeannot Szwarc's ""Supergirl"". Ta Lo is a country within a country. Growing up without a mother, Xialing, saddled with a father who abided by the unyielding tradition of China's patriarchal strictures put on women, she could just watch in secrecy as Shang-Chi, training to be an assassin, fought alongside the men; a boy among men, shadowing his every move. That's China. As the forgotten daughter, waiting for her father to show up, Jiang Nan(Michelle Yeoh), to Xiangling's surprise, is informed that men and women train and fight like egalitarians. That's not China; that's a Chinese utopia. Shang-Li, previously attacked stateside, in which his cover as a underachiever is blown, when the car valet reveals himself to be Bruce Lee incarnate on a moving bus, to the amazement of Katy(Awkwafina), his childhood friend, disposing all-comers with exceptional ease. Under attack again, this time in his home country, once again he faces the same gang, this time, joined by Xiangling, at a fight club, an enterprise she built from scratch, it goes unsaid, to earn her father's love after leaving home as a lost sixteen-year-old girl. Just as Shang-Li is about to put the finishing touch on his old trainer, identifiable by a fancy yellow and black mask. The father uses the ten rings to stop Shang-Chi. It's a strange reunion. With paternal love, Mandarin admits that he put a hit on Shang-Chi. But like a proud papa, he knew that his assassin training would, more likely than not, stave off annihilation, and is overjoyed that he was right. Nothing personal, he just wanted the pendant. The same hit is put on Xiangling, but in the absence of a similar heart-to-heart talk, the father implies an indifference to his daughter's life. The father has enough love for just one child.An actor lives under their father's roof; an actor who once impersonated Mandarin, as a decoy for Aldrich Killian(Guy Pearce), a terrorist, in Shane Black's ""Iron Man 3"". Trevor Slattery(Ben Kingsley), this time, has no role to play; his Fu Manchu beard is gone. He plays himself. On the surface, Trevor Slattery's appearance can seem contrived, because otherwise, ""Shang Chi"" would be a stand-alone movie, untethered from the Marvel Universe. Duly noted, by countless film theorists, no doubt, Kingsley is sending-up..., who some believe was impersonating...in the network television series ""Kung Fu"". Lee, however, did star in ""The Green Hornet"", playing Kato, a sidekick to the titular star. It's ""The Green Hornet""(green, the same color as the emerald pendants), not ""Kung Fu"", that's explicitly referenced in ""Shang-Chi"", especially when Xiangling instigates an escape from her father's compound by literally breaking down a wall. In the getaway car, Slattery sits shotgun; he doesn't get to be the hero. Katy drives. Brother and sister, the superheroes, sit in the back like VIPs. Slattery is the sidekick, not to the hero like Kato was, but to the hero's best friend. Quite pointedly, in Tai Lo, the film simultaneously tweaks, but also rejects the Hollywood trope of... The native people fight their own battles. When Razor Fist(Florian Monteau), whose right hand is a machete blade, fight with the villagers, he's an equal, not a savior, and also, it's the prudent choice. They have a common enemy, a demonic beast with tentacles of behemoth proportions. Meanwhile, as both sides combine forces to stop this hellacious creature from being let loose into the outside world, Slattery plays dead, in an act of character arc subversion. He's just a coward. Whereas in ""Enter the Dragon"", the hero saves his country, in ""Shang-Chi"", the hero saves the world.Her smile is genuine. The woman of the snow looks like a natural born domestic. The perfect wife and mother. She smiles with pride at the woodcutter's cleverness, making new sandals for her and their three children. She tries them on. It's a perfect fit. The betrayal is complete; she wears the wood from murdered trees. She returns to her sewing. And then, like something out of an inverted ""Vertigo"", Minokichi, seeing his wife barefoot again, perhaps, the woman of the snow comes back into the woodcutter's life, a ghost from the past. Being recognized, Yuki returns to the woods feeling great shame about the unspoken vow of chastity she broke by being involved with the trees' enemy, a woodcutter. It was real love, though. Yuki keeps the sandals.What about Li? Did she really love The Mandarin, or did she love mankind, marrying him to protect earth from the awesome power of the ten rings.",negative
143,"Visually, one of the most beautiful movies in MCU. More than that, one of the best solo super hero movies in MCU, a grand feat for a debut, even more so without other superheroes like ""crutch"". The performances make justice for the script, showing us that End Game, contrary to what was believed, wasn't the end of Marvel Era. The phase 4 promises be even greater than others. This quality can be easily compared to Black Panter and Captain America and The Winter Soldier level.Engaging and with the right dose between comedy and battle, the film has impressive fight choreographies.The credit scenes make connection between the Shang-Chi story to the MCU in a curious way. Can't wait to see what Feige is planning for the future.",positive
144,"I've been watching Marvel films for years and while I do almost always enjoy them I often come out underwhelmed, Shang Chi actually managed to pleasantly surprise me and while I do think it dragged slightly in the third act I really enjoyed it.The film manages to balance it's humour and seriousness far better than other marvel property's and also incorporates aspects from other films without feeling too forced, instead adding to the worldbuilding. The action is possibly the best of any Marvel film and obviously takes a lot of influence from Jackie Chan films with I believe the stunt coordinator having worked with Chan in the past. The acting is all good with Simu Liu really shining and while I wasn't a massive fan of Awkwafina's character at the start I did find myself liking her development in the final act, I think Shang Chi manages to take what works so well about the MCU and polish it but this doesn't mean it's without it's flaws.I did enjoy the emotional link between the villain and Shang Chi, but I thought that there were far too many flash backs telling us of how this relationship has developed, I also think that the third act was a bit of a let down with the action evolving into pretty basic CGI fights and most of the personal edge that lent itself so well to the rivalry between Shang Chi and Win Wu being lost. There are also some big plot holes and things that just don't make sense, the score is underwhelming and I'm not a massive fan of some of the villain's costume designs, however while this film does have it's flaws it was still a very enjoyable movie that I will likely watch again, the cast is good, cinematography different from the usual stuff the MCU has to offer and I like that Marvel didn't shy away from using a lot of subtitles and having characters speaking lot's of Chinese. Very enjoyable and I'd recommend it to any Marvel fan. 7/10.",negative
145,"After the big disappointment of Black Widow, it's safe to say I was anticipating a better outing for Shang Chi and thankfully I lived up.The action is the films biggest plus point. It's where the best scenes are on show, the choreography is brilliant alongside its kung fu/John Wick style fights.The visuals are typical of a Marvel film, solid as always. The film however lost its emotional resonance through its writing. The heart of a film mainly comes from the screenplay and I felt the writing was slightly lazy in parts and that heart faded.It's neither a perfect nor terrible film, it's a solid one that I enjoyed, even if it was hard to truly gravitate towards the characters.Quote - 'Welcome to the Circus' - WongRating - 3/5.",positive
146,The MCU is getting out of it's repetitive train of movies with an all new Asian epic inspiring a new generation!,positive
147,"I was really hoping to like Shang-Chi but I couldn't because of mainly three reasons: the first one is the most severe and it is the fact that I found myself very bored, especially in the last hour. I spent that time hoping that I could have the ability to skip 10 second at will like on YouTube. The second problem is the fact that Shang-Chi itself is not an interesting character as far as this movie treats him. He surely has potential and it is clear that Marvel will be high on him in the future and I still have hope but in this movie I think I preferred at least four characters more than him and he is the protagonist. And finally the plot has various holes, especially regarding the Ten Rings as a criminal organization. The visuals and the action are good but it wasn't enough for me to like this movie.PS: the mid-credit scene is the best of the movie, really liked that one.",negative
148,"First of all, I think People are overhyping this film a bit like they did Black Panther. Is this the Best MCU Origin Film Ever ?? Hell No !! There are atleast 3 better origin stories existing. But there's a lot of good things Shang-Chi does that differentiates this film from the normal MCU film. The Visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and unlike any MCU film I have seen. The tone of the film resembles Chinese Action Movies more rather than MCU which is so refreshing. The first few fight scenes are just incredible and got me super hyped but the quality falls in the later scenes when it becomes a CGI Monsterfest. The story is very predictable and full of narration and exposition. At its core its a very emotional family drama but the dialogues are not powerful enough to dig really deep and I craved for that in so many scenes. The performances are solid with Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley providing great Comedic Relief, but the standout is Tony Leung. He generates such level of empathy and emotional suffering with just his eyes, He is the Legend after all. Overall its a really fun watch, but not as great as people are shouting it is.",negative
149,The movie was awesome and very inspiring to all marvel fans . Akwafina was absolutely hilarious and a great fighter . Shang chi is about to join the avengers for the first time after endgame. I have this feeling Shang chi and doctor strange will have to travel through time and space to Find all places that he's never seen before. I hope to see Shang chi travel to New York City or meet guardians of the galaxy and captain marvel and find some connections to the mcu .,positive
150,"It feels like a mash up of about 10 old movies anc 20 plots weaved into one film, for me I didn't enjoy it very much, there were positives but overall I didn't leave feeling like I'd seen something that special. It didn't feel like a marvel film, I'm not against diversity or going in different directions but it just wasn't a film I loved or would see again. The characters were bland and uninspiring, the humour was ok but bit same old same old and the plot which I'd guess you'd call the main theme felt a bit daft.The cgi was awesome, graphics, choreography and costumes all really nice, parts were genuinely beautiful but if the film ain't doing much for me that doesn't matter.Think a lot would hinge on whether you got this gimmick or liked it, I didn't, they were cool for set pieces and what they wanted to achieve in the movie but I just felt they weren't something I thought was interesting or that impressive.It was always going one way, it was pretty predictable and I didn't feel or believe the emotion as I found the story a bit stupid, it just felt directionless and they were trying to do so much whilst achieving very little.It felt long to, much longer than the run time, it just wasn't a film I'd recommend and it was one I felt disappointed.I maybe backwards though as everyone's saying this makes up for black widow, I don't get that, I thought black widow was brilliant. Way better than this.Also it seems if it's Asian and a bit funny everyone calls awkwafina.",negative
151,"For the latest flick in the MCU Shang-Chi, it's magnificently assembled with a stellar cast like 'Crazy Rich Asians' stars Awkwafina and Michelle Yeoh combined with an interesting performance of Tony Leung as the villainous Mandarin. Simu Liu as the lead is a welcoming addition to the Marvel family with his martial arts skills and adds more to this ever-growing universe.The visuals, the fight choreography, and an interesting soundtrack to boot! It makes you think this is more like a martial arts fantasy film rather than a typical Marvel movie. I also took notice of the moral values and quirks usually seen in Asian families that it began to remind me of the most recent film Crazy Rich in a way in terms of valuing your heritage and roots, but learning that your past doesn't dictate what you should become many years later.At 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, Simu Liu spoke about what it's like to be part of Marvel. He was so humble to speak of it. After what I've seen in this movie, it makes sense on why he said at the panel of him citing Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman (respect) as an influence in taking on this lead role. Chadwick helped open that door for him, he took it, and made it his own for audiences who look like him.After all that's transpired in the MCU since 2008, I can't wait to see where else Shang-Chi will go next from here. I recommend it.",positive
152,"First thing first, this film is great, visually a treat for any lover of cinema, combat fighting and some well timed comedic moments but the story leaves something to be desired.Simu Liu as a leading man in this movie is great to embody this character. He's fighting prowess can probably only be matched to the daredevil Tv series in such choreographed fight scenes. Very different styles but this follows effortlessly from him during this movie. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, What more can be said about this performance! As the true Mandarin i would love to have seen him face off against iron man, the power creep is massive but this would be epic! Awkwafina just annoying the only words i want to talk about her character, when she was falling from the bamboo scaffolding i hoped that was the end of her arc. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang we good for supporting roles but nothing really different we've seen in the past. Mother figure after their actual mother has been killed and then the ambitious sister that always feels hard done by and in the shadow of her bother.By the end of the film they all band together to defeat the bad guy standard stuff! That portal at the end is that a path to the Dark dimension? Maybe something thats going to be explored in Doctor Strange 2. Wong and the Abominations appearance has already been revealed. Nice details placed in those moments with Wong return Abomination to the raft.Overall the action was great, casting for the leads perfect, the story was very simple and no real revelations by the end of it. Does this beat Iron Man, no, Captain america the first avenger, close but yes, Thor, yes, Captain marvel, 10000%, Ant Man, nope. Middle of the road first movie with a lot to build on!!",negative
153,"I can tell you the reason to see this film is solely based on the performance of the incredible Hong Kong actor Tony Leung as Shang-Chi's father Wenwu aka the real MANDARIN. He literally carried this film on his back. For those who aren't film buffs, Tony Leung is basically Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Denzel Washington and Brad Pitt combined in Hong Kong. Even though Hollywood has knocked on his door a few times, finally, better late than never, he gets his due in Hollywood.Simu Liu throughout most of the film, I thought was alright, nothing too special, nothing too terrible. However, he has two incredible moments in the film where then I was completely sold on his character. A great display of acting, one of which involves a scene with Tony Leung where he calls out his failure as a parent. What I also admired is that Shang-Chi also has blood on his hands. He reveals this to Awkwafina's Katy and Simu doesn't overdo his performance in that scene. You felt his anger, his guilt and his remorse. This reveal reminded me he almost killed the Death Dealer, seeing and knowing this makes his character a bit more rich and complex. I appreciated that he wasn't a saint.The relationship between Shang-Chi and his father Wenwu on the surface does involve superhero theatrics, however underneath it, it does have a very relatable dynamic. As an Asian myself, I think it will hit home to most Asians and their relationship with their parents.But despite all that, I did not love the film like I wanted to. It still falls under the same old formulaic humor I despise, mainly coming from Awkwafina. I will however concede that I did expect the humor to be a lot worse and thankfully it isn't too unbearable. But if it were up to me, ""less is more."" I had some inkling that Sir Ben Kingsley would show up and he does add the redundant humor into the mix.Although it works on some level, the story mainly lumbers along, obsessed with backstory. On the one hand I did feel the drag, but in the other I felt the flashbacks did help flesh out Wenwu, Shang-Chi and his sister Xialing whom Meng'er Zhang does a good job portraying. Fala Chen also had a great supporting role as Shang-Chi's mother.While the creatures showcased in final act are pretty cool like the Great Protector, I particularly disliked Morris the faceless chicken-pig that accompanied Ben Kingsley's Trevor Slattery and found the addition very unnecessary. Speaking of unnecessary Florian Munteanu's Razor Fist was not needed. I felt all his screen time could have been devoted to the Death Dealer who I was more interested in.I also did feel like they took some tropes and traditions of Asian cinema and did not present anything unique on their own take and in doing so I got this feeling that at least half of the film did not know what it wanted to be other than an Asian American hero in the MCU.To sum it up, a stellar first half, where then Marvel eventually goes back into their comfort zone by the third act. Despite Tony Leung's magic as a performer and Simu Liu's best efforts it is ultimately another okay entry to the MCU as opposed to the top tier level films that took big swings like INFINITY WAR, the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy or the first GUARDIANS. Again, being an Asian myself I wanted to love this film, but I didn't, I just thought it was okay.Two post credits scenes so stay put.7/10.",negative
154,"Awakafina ruining another movie. Her acting is baaaad she not funny, the movie is pretty boring so much CGI it makes ones head hurt I can see why they didn't accept this movie in China it was baaaad.K thanks byeeee.",negative
155,"The Good: The Action. This movie excels at delivering some of the best fight scenes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, thankfully. There are nice long takes and fixed shots; the camera is spinning around and there's great energy to these fights. The first bus scene is a stand out (even if the background actors are a little TOO comfortable with what's happening) and the final fights are great.I also really liked seeing Chinese mythological creatures in full, expensive Hollywood glory. I'm not Chinese, but having been fascinated by the differences between Western and Eastern mythical creatures, I really got a kick out that.The Bad: Unfortunately, there is a lot of meh and bad here. Simu Liu is fine, but similar to Captain Marvel and Black Panther, he has no discernible character and feels like a sidekick in HIS OWN MOVIE. The movie juggles so many (mostly) pointless characters, that it loses sight of the core character and the obvious emotional arc of the film. Awkwafina is mostly pretty superfluous here and unnecessary. As his sister. As is...well, most of the people in this movie.The main villain, played by the legendary Tony Leung, is only watchable because it's well...Tony Leung. They don't want to call him the Mandarin (even though it's the name of the primary Chinese language, but...okay) and while the movie makes fun of Iron Man 2's whitewashing, I have to say...Ben Kingsley did it a lot better. This version is pretty bland and pointless. Of course, there's a second villain, this nondescript, nameless dragon creature and we get this big stupid CG fight at the end. Marvel for ya.The movie is also arranged in a baffling way, with numerous flashbacks happening 40-50 minutes too late. This movie also drags A LOT in the middle and to be honest, I can barely remember what happened then and I saw this movie last night.The Ugly: I know that this movie is a win for Asian representation. That this movie has an almost entirely Chinese/CBC/ABC cast (look up what those mean), is
set mostly in China with about 50% of the dialog in Mandarin AND is the highest grossing movie in North America is meaningful. I get it. But, maybe it's because I watch A LOT of East Asian cinema already that this fact alone isn't enough for me, personally. It's a mediocre movie and I don't think we should just give big studios a pass, just because the representation is important.",negative
156,"One of the real standouts for me in the movie was the fights scenes. The MCU is not really known for having interesting fight scenes and really most of them are just bland and cliché but Shang-Chi brought something new and I loved it. Every single fight scene was so well done and paced super well and Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed this, did an amazing job directing the fight scenes in this movie. The fight scenes in this movie were probably the best part especially since you can tell that all of the actors in this movie, especially Simu Liu, did most of the stunt work themselves. It's also insane to think that other than this movie Simu Liu has only really acted in one other thing but you could barely tell. He played Shang-Chi so well and brought so much emotion that everybody can easily relate to and love him. Honestly, everybody did an amazing job acting in this movie and I have to say I was skeptical with Awkwafina, who plays Katy, but she proved me wrong. But for me, the real scene-stealer was Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, who plays Xu Wenwu, as the villain. The villains in Marvel movies are mediocre at best but he decided to change that with this movie. Xu Wenwu was such an intriguing villain that the audience can easily sympathize with and relate to him. The cinematography in this movie is gorgeous to look at and you can see the detail that was put into it. Depending on where the movie is at the lighting reflects that area. I will say though is that this movie has a bit of slower pacing that at times does work in its favour but in other parts, I very much was wanting the movie to hurry up. In the end, Shang-Chi is such a heartfelt Marvel movie that does have some issues but is still enjoyable.",negative
157,"If you rarely are disappointed with Marvel films, and you consider yourself a big fan of them, then you will most likely enjoy this film. It's certainly better than a few of the last installments (by a small margin), but this film is proof to all others that there really aren't any fresh ideas anymore, and the Marvel antics are getting rather boring.You have good guy who is lackluster in personality, has some family issues, turns out he's a very important guy in the world, has some impressive abilities which he hones, discovers things about himself, has someone close to him betray him, has to make some big decisions, engages in climactic fight, the end.These movies are so cookie-cutter, all Marvel is now, is predictable pomp and circumstance with flashy lights and SOME, not many, redeeming qualities. Let's start with those first:Choreography. There are some slick-nasty moves in most of the fight scenes. Action scenes, and entertaining fights is certainly one thing Marvel rarely disappoints.Humor. Another typical trait of a Marvel film, you get some good chuckles here and there. However without Awkwafina, this trait would be almost non-existent. And this is coming from someone who usually doesn't care for the smarky humor of the latest generations. But she is rather funny without being TOO annoying and sarcastic.Special effects and cinematography. Solid work, obviously they didn't downsize their SFX department. But compared to the bar set by previous movies in the Marvel world, it's not all that impressive.On to the unflattering traits:Story. WOOF. Predictable through and through, don't expect much of anything here. They could easily have held a writing competition at any average middle school for the students to write a basic action movie script, and the storyline for this film would have probably been the entry from the kid who won 3rd place.Characters. Aside from a a select few, the characters are as flat as a pancake in a hydraulic press.The humor and the action. While I mentioned this earlier as a pro, over time, it all got old towards the end. The attempts at humor starting falling short of the goal, and the action became stale.It's about time to wrap up this dynasty of Marvel movies and move onto something else before it starts to smell like discarded scraps of reused ideas, and accumulate maggots of banality.",negative
158,"Typical cheesiness of every Marvel movie. I enjoy Marvel movies, but already know to go into them open to a certain degree of unseriousness and just enjoy them for what they are. That being said, I thought Shang Chi was actually one of the stronger Marvel movies I've seen. It did become cheesy with the dragons, but the fight scenes were top notch. The acting was strong and Awkwafina was hilarious. Overall, a solid movie. Not the best, but stronger than most.",negative
159,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining albeit formulaic popcorn Marvel film that's part-family drama and part-kung fu adventure that is raised by Tony Leung's villainous performance as Wenwu. It delivers a solid introduction to an Asian American superhero while paying tribute to Chinese martial arts films.First off, it's very pleasing to see the warm reception Shang-Chi has received across the world. It's a phenomenon to see English-speaking audiences intensely cheering for a subtitled film that has large portions in Mandarin. Back in my university days, the average Western filmgoer typically would not see a foreign subtitled movie on the account of not wanting ""to read a movie."" Look at how much the world has changed now.The first half of Shang-Chi plays much stronger. The San Francisco bus sequence is reminiscent of a Hollywood big-budgeted version of 90's Jackie Chan films set in Western locales, like Rumble in the Bronx, Who Am I or First Strike.The fight choreography moves from hard fisticuffs towards fantastical wuxia, and plunges into more and more CGI. The former is more engaging with Shang-Chi being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time in a real setting.Simu Liu does a solid job as Shang-Chi and has impressive moves. Like an athlete, he sells the hits and moves swiftly when performing parkour. Liu grew on me throughout the movie, much to the aid of the always-charismatic Awkwafina as his best friend Katy. They share a charming banter as if they were doubling as their own R2-D2 and C-3PO.The film's MVP is Tony Leung, who approaches his role with an award-worthy intensity, injecting a depth and gravitas to his villain that elevates the film to another level.I was amazed by the depth Leung achieved through his scenes. The scene that struck me was a flashback where Tony Leung's Wenwu comes home through his door and gives a look of concern to his own family. In that one glance, Leung portrays a completely different person in contrast to the villain in the present. His performance cut right through me and I felt I was watching someone suffer.It is unfortunate as Wenwu is undercut by the script introducing a second villain late in the second half, which diminishes Leung's character. Wenwu is established as an immortal who's fought for power through the ages, yet there's a lack of wisdom in his latter actions that felt unconvincing.Shang-Chi's third act takes a strange turn into mythic realms and loses the gravitas that was promised in the first act. The story shifts into a westerner's stereotypical view of China. We get the straw hats, the rice paddy village that looks Cambodian, and the constant mention of dragons. With a CGI-infused finale spectacle, the movie then exhausts all the good will earned from the first half.Shang-Chi is entertaining Marvel fare that will be remembered best as a cultural zeitgeist icon for Asian American representation. However, as a film, I don't feel the need to revisit it anytime soon. When I will, it will be for the San Francisco section and Tony Leung scenes.I am Asian, not Asian American. I'm happy for other Asian Americans who feel represented by Shang-Chi. I personally do not feel that representation from this film and am fine with that. Looking at the film itself, I admit Shang-Chi is one great step in the Asian American representation fight. However, it's apparent there's still a heck of a long way to go...",negative
160,"I was super excited for this film and at the start of the year it was probably my most anticipated film of the year. It definitely did not disappoint me! This film is massive fun, massive action and has massive heart. The action scenes are so cool and the choreography is amazing in the fight scenes and the martial arts look so good. I love the jokes between the two main characters and the banter they have together is great fun. This is a good way to do an origin film this far into the MCU, it sort of flicks between flash backs and the present day and it keeps the pacing of the film fresh and quick. Shang-chi as a character isn't super well known but just like the guardians of the galaxy I think he will become a household name. The shots in this film are gorgeous at times and have some beautiful bright colours and amazing Chinese settings. Some of the effects fail a little bit but it's not enough to harm the film at all. I loved this film and I'm so happy to be back into the marvel universe once again!",negative
161,"**What I didn't love**Some decision making by the characters were a little bit off-putting and unclearMotivations likewisePlot, pacing, storyline were a little off in some places (e.g. Shang chi's power progression was a questionable moment for me; bit of an abrupt ending)Theaters are really trying to milk the pre-show value... it was close to 35 minutes dammit**What I liked (Not in a particular order)**Great music. Gonna check out the actual soundtrack (BIBI is on it!!)CG was straight up amazing. In comparison to some recent Marvel movies I watched (cough black widow cough), they really pulled it off on this oneAwkwafina is hilarious. She really carried this movie. Added the lightness that is present in all Marvel moviesRings as a weapon is SUCH an amazing concept. They really visualized it wellMartial arts actions scenes were not as cringe as I expected (except for the one where they fall in love)I really appreciate the growing Asian representation in Hollywood films. They really did a good job making it culturally ""Asian"" but not cringe like... some other examples!Overall, pretty solid Marvel film - I hope to see this franchise grow and evolve as this movie was by far not perfect but really good for a starter;",negative
162,"A Marvel Legend has risen and it only took 40 years to become an overnight sensation.""Kim's Convenience"" star Simu Liu breathes life into the title character who's changed his birth name to Shaun.What a stretch when you don't want to be found by your estranged dad, Xu Wenwu otherwise known as The Mandarin, played by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (in his first American film) who has more rings than Ringo Starr or the Olympics.What can I say this guy loves his bling.Rapper/Actor Awkwafina is his BFF, Katy.Together Shaun goes out of his way to avoid bringing back the dead with his wisecracking ""Crazy Rich Asian"" girlfriend in tow.Simu was so intent of getting this gig that back in 2018 he tweeted Marvel for the role.Kung Fu fans are in for a solid 2 hour plus fight spectacular, which doesn't stop too long to draw breath.This movie never gets boring.It's Action, Adventure and Fantasy all rolled into one thrill ride straight out of the Marvel Universe.I kind of half expected 80's Singer, Limahl to crank out ""Never Ending Story"" in the final act of this epic movie thanks to one of the legendary creatures hiding out in a mythical village not unlike Shangri-La from 1937's classic ""Lost Horizon"".Car maker BMW clearly have a product placement deal with Producer, Kevin Feige.They are driven, crushed or smashed in every automobile scene.Hawaiian Director, Destiny Daniel Cretton, best known for ""Just Mercy"" and ""The Glass Castle"" does a marvellous job with the Screen Play and Screen Story he helped write based on the source material from Marvel Comics Steve Engelhart and Jim Starlin.This movie idea has been floating around since the 80's when the late Stan Lee wanted Bruce Lee's son, Brandon to play the lead, but that plan fell through.Australia actually played a huge part in this movie finally being produced despite World War C's best attempt in 2020 to shut down production.Watch out for: Michelle Yeoh plus Aussies Ronnie Chieng, Lynette Curran and Lydia Sarks (from the Toyota Commercials) as the hilarious Flight Attendant.Like all good Marvel movies there is an Easter Egg worth waiting for before the cinema lights come on and the curtains close on the big screen.And just like the movie this review doesn't mention the title till the final frame, ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"".Do yourself a favour and take the family to see the 25th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe which is full of surprises and cameos.MCU's first with an Asian leading Superhero Protagonist!",negative

165,"This is just like any other Marvel movie; the only difference is the majority of the cast is Chinese. Which was the same situation with Black Panther, so it isn't new.It's still an action movie, there's a lot of humor sprinkled throughout much of which comes from a ""quirky"" sidekick, it ends with a big CG battle, and there's more setup for the next thing during the end credits. It's tiresome now.The action is good, the acting is good, the story is fine, the characters are fine, the music is fine; overall, it is an entertaining movie, but the Marvel formula can only work for so long. For me, anyway.",positive
166,"I once said after watching Black Panther, that it would be cool if there was an all Asian cast similar to it. There were some all Asian cast movies like Crazy Rich Asian (2018), but that is a romcom, and Mulan (2020), but that was bad. In comes Shang Chi which is the first Asian lead Superhero movie ever. The premise is ""Martial-arts master Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) confronts the past he thought he left behind when he's drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization"". So does Shang Chi succeed in giving us a good all Asian cast big blockbuster or is it just another failed attempt?Firstly, the action sequences and choreography are some of the best from Marvel since Captain America and the Winter Soldier (2014). Martial arts are the focus of the action scenes in Shang Chi and they are beautifully choreographed. We get the classic wire-fu/floating style of Crouching Tiger but we also get some Jackie Chan style with the utilization of the environment for the action. Each action scene is memorable and stunning to watch. Additionally, the action scenes avoid using lots of cuts and shaky cam which I was so grateful for. It is also clear that the actors themselves rehearsed the choreography making the fights feel more believable and gratifying. It does become a more typical MCU action sequence by the third act but even that is still pretty enjoyable even if it isn't as good as the first two acts.The cinematography by Bill Pope (Matrix trilogy, Spiderman 2 and 3, Scott Pilgrim) is also excellent in Shang Chi. Skyscrapers and forests in Marvel movies have never looked as good as it has in Shang Chi. Bill pope and director Destin use the lighting and colours very effectively and allow for some genuinely beautiful shots. The music score by Joel P. West is also pretty good. Joel utilizes more electronic sounds and pop/rap songs for the scenes in the city but uses more traditional Asian instruments for the mystical areas. Joel's score captures the scene and the pop/rap songs themselves are also quite good albeit not as memorable as the Weeknd or Lamar from Black Panther. I also love the story and exploration of ""family"" with Shang Chi whilst not using Asian stereotypes. It also doesn't overuse humour like in Marvel's previous outing, Black Widow (2021), where they use jokes every couple of minutes and ruin a serious scene. Shang Chi thankfully avoids doing this, thus allowing the emotion of a scene to linger longer. There are still jokes though but they are genuinely quite funny.Furthermore, Simu Liu is charismatic, charming and cool as the titular character Shang Chi. I think Marvel succeeds again in the casting department as Simu Liu delivers on making me believe that this guy is a top tier martial artist. I also think Simu gives a good performance during the more emotional moments as well. His chemistry with Awkwafina who plays Shang Chi's friend Katy is great too. The banter between Shang Chi and Katy is some of the funniest scenes and makes me believe that those two were friends for years. However, Tony Leung who plays the main villain Wenwu (the real Mandarin) is the one that steals the show. Tony Leung is just phenomenal as he can convey the exact emotions of his character just through body language alone, it is just masterful acting. My biggest worry with MCU origin movies is that the villains are lacklustre but Shang Chi does not fall into this. Wenwu is very sympathetic but also extremely fearsome. He is also the father of Shang Chi which makes the conflict between them feel more meaningful and tragic. Wenwu is not a straight-up evil person as he does still have good in him and I like that.Unfortunately, Shang Chi suffers from having the 3 villain problem. Razorfist played by Florian is Wenwu's henchman and he doesn't get any backstory. I don't mind him that much though as he is mostly there to chase Shang Chi like a 007 henchman. There is also a scene where he does seem visibly worried about Wenwu's health which gives him some character depth. On the other hand, the 3rd villain Death Dealer who is a mysterious assassin of Wenwu is a massive disappointment. He looks very cool and visibly distinct from other ten ring members and is relevant to Shang Chi's past but amounts to absolutely nothing.Moreover, there is also a 3rd hero to Shang Chi and Katy with Shang Chi's sister Xialing played by Meng'er Zhang. She doesn't get enough interactions with Shang Chi, Katy or her father Wenwu and that feels like a waste. It's a shame as her interactions with both Shang Chi and Katy are enjoyable and she also doesn't interact with her dad Wenwu which is just a missed opportunity for her character. The movie also has a pacing issue as it slows down significantly in the second act. It just featured a lot of talking, exposition and flashbacks which I felt could have been cut down by a couple of minutes.Overall, Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the all Asian cast movie I have been waiting for. It delivers on the action, story and characters while being an exciting new addition to the MCU. I can't wait to see more of Shang Chi and finally get to see an Asian in the Avengers team.",negative
167,"After a brief gap of theatrical release (not considering Black Widow as it had a partial release), MARVEL is back in theatres introducing to the characters of the new phase of their universe. Shang Chi The Legend Of Ten Rings is a standalone film but equally also serves as an important piece of puzzle in the events linking to the web series' and upcoming movies. It goes without saying that watching all the recently released series on Disney+ is as important as following these movies in order.As the trailer shows and also the name suggests Shang Chi is a movie whose action heavily lean towards the martial arts and individual battles. It is a different watch as compared to other MARVEL movies which involve a lot of hi tech dependent action. The movie hardly wastes any time on the lead character's introduction and straightway jumps into the 'purpose'. Having experienced the 'blip' after the infinity war, the normal people aren't surprised anymore when supernatural things and high octane action happens around them. Hence the character here is hardly wasting any time on hiding their identities from the public. The storyline is pretty straightforward and the movie has strong resemblance to Black Panther because of the lead character's connection to his place of origin. The action sequences are shot brilliantly and some of the camera and lighting work is mind blowing. The movie relies on good hand to hand combat almost until the climax and I believe if MARVEL had gone for an R rating, the action sequences would have been much better to watch. I personally think some incidents happening around climax were way too convenient. Last but not the least, the background music just elevates most scenes into a whole new level.Simu Liu has what it takes to bring the Asian heritage to the superhero universe. The movie doesn't test much of his emotional side and I believe we will get to see more in the upcoming movies. Tony Leung shines in his powerful antagonist role and Awkwafina drives the comical side of things as Shang Chi's close buddy who is almost a sidekick. Rest of the cast have done a decent job and do look out for a surprise funny cameo ;-)MARVEL expands its universe with Shang Chi by exploring a different culture and heritage in the superhero genre. It is a satisfying watch for a MARVEL fan and a great watch for any action movie fans.",positive
168,"To me, it seemed to be made for the Chinese Market rather than the MCU fans & rest of the world. The lead & his best friend are good, along with the rest of the cast but the plot & story telling is poor. How & why Shangs mother ever married his father, maked no sense whatsoever. Most of the action scenes are too fast, too dark & when not dark, too blurred & CGI'd. If you want to see great action scenes, watch old Jackie Chan movies where you can actually see what is happening. Too much reliance on CGI & too long. This is not in my top 20 MCU
4/10.",negative
169,"Overall: 91/100This is more geared towards non-Marvel people than for the Marvel people.Quick & Dirty: I loved it and would highly recommend seeing this film in theatres. Visually stunning, fantastic fight scenes, great story, and emotionally driven. Due to one too many lulls perhaps a slight bit too long in length, but overall, very enjoyable.When I was teen I loved watching Asian films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", & ""Ong-Bak"". This film had the great martial arts fighting sequences that the aforementioned films had. I felt like I was a kid again enjoying something fresh and new. I also fully enjoyed the combination of Mandarin (apologies if that's wrong) and English. A movie with subtitles always reminds me that there's more than the bubble of North American film.The acting was great. Michelle Yeoh was the one who stole the show for me at the end of the day. Again, it reminded of the good old days of martial arts movies that depended on the actors to make things believable instead of lots of CGI.I watch virtually zero Marvel movies and so if you're iffy on whether to watch this or not it shouldn't stop you from enjoying this film. It's funny, action packed, and does not appear to be culturally inappropriate. The acting is great and the length of the film, while a little long, is still exceptional.PS... there are two after the credits scenes so make sure you have time sit until the very end.Enjoy the show!",negative

175,"""Reel Tunez: The Radio Show All About the Movies"" Movie Review (9/8/21): ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings""First, when people on IMDB rate a movie (though VERY good) a 9 or 10, I really want to ask ""So it's a 10.. the VERY BEST movie EVER.. as good as ""Sound of Music"", ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Oliver"", ""Star Wars"" and movies that probably DO get a 9 or 10?? To me.. YES.. an excellent movie. But people skew the ratings by calling everything a 9 or 10. With that said, I'd give it between a 7 and 8 (which is VERY good), but a little closer to a 7 (7.4).Yet another Marvel Studio (Disney) release to the Marvel Universe. I knew nothing about this movie and didn't really have a lot of interest in seeing it, but GLAD I did! It was fun.. and it was exciting! Excellent adventure movie that had great effects and great story line.If you like adventure movies.. even if you haven't followed the Marvel Universe, you really don't have to know the history of the other movies to enjoy this one.I will add the following (which is not a spoiler): Do NOT leave the movie until the very VERY last of the credits have rolled and they turn on the lights to clean the place. As the movie ends, we go into one last restaurant scene. Then in the middle of the credits, we get MORE story. Then after the last of the credits.. even after ""Marvel Studio Cleaning Crew: Bob the Janitor and Mae his wife"", we get ONE more scene at the end. These Marvel extras are consistent and basically a clue into what comes next.On a 1-10 scaled, I'd give this a very good 7.4! This is a BIG screen movie, so see it at the theater.",positive
176,"Shang-Chi is a great character with a compelling backstory. I look forward to seeing him in future MCU movies. There's a lot of fun in this movie, with a nice variety of well-choreographed action.However, I have to dock a star for the way they gave up on Xu Wenwu's character development in the middle of the film. Here's a character with centuries of blood and conquest who gives this up voluntarily to become a family man. This is important both as a personal narrative, as well as for institutional parallels. Even after the death of his wife, he uses the opportunity to teach Shang-Chi about the importance of a blood debt, and then cools back to ""family man"". After his ""family man"" persona is established, his character moves mechanically and in uninteresting fashion as a plot device to further Shang-Chi's character.Docking another star for excessive use of comedic interruption. Plenty of the side dialogue was quite fun, but too often the tension in action scenes was cut unnecessarily for comedic relief that really wasn't that good. With so much casual death, the humor should be dark if at all.Docking one more star for the contrived motivations for fights. Halfway through we find out that Wenwu had no expectation of killing his children when sending his goons, yet he wasted the resources anyway because it was fun for us to watch. Then Wenwu decides to burn the village where his wife is being kept without any real deliberation or dialogue. Sure it was a fun fight to watch, but it largely could've been ignored. We also burned plenty of CGI getting these animals to fight, pretty much just because it looks cool.Lastly, Shang-Chi admits to killing his mother's killer, but we never see the actual scene. Looking forward to when that is finally shown, either in the extended cut release, or in a later film.",positive
177,"This movie is worthy of praise, it truly represented the people, history and lore of the legend. Early reports said this was the Asian version of Black Panther and that could not be further from the truth. Despite sales, Black Panther was hands down the worst film Marvel released, until Black Widow snatched that crown. You get invested in these characters and had they cast a better side kick other than the unattractive, not funny, Awkwafina I probably would have considered a 9 for the film. I don't know who blessed her with the Asian female Kevin Hart title, but she is awful in everything. I hate her voice, hate acting and her face is 100% Cabage Patch.I know nothing about these comics, but I truly want to know more about Changs Father and the legacy of the rings. I would assume that will be explored in the sequel, but again, the writer and director deserve praise for how they unfolded and told the story. Phase 4 was not looking promising, but this was aa strong entry and worthy of the same praise Iron Man got. Shang may be the New MCU Poster Boy. The pace probably could have been quickened. At 2:20, it was probably at least 10 minutes minimum too long.That said, it's a great story, acted and directed well and the only irritant was Awkwafina. Comparing her to Kevin Hart is an insult to Kevin, she is the Asian Female Jerry Lewis and that is one clown I could live a lifetime without having ever seen!",negative

And what a story unfolds on screen!!!A little Crouching Tiger, a splash of Rush Hour 2, and a hint of Mortal Kombat combined with Bruce Lee's kicks and Akwafina's comedic timing turn this origin story into an original style for the superhero universe! Might have been bad if it were in the wrong hands, but actors and director, the crew and producers, all together show their love of the story in every scene!Behind every superhero is a story of loss, and it is doubly true for Shang-Chi! His journey to redemption is littered in Marvel lore, and the connections to other Marvel films is as suprising as it is awesome! Cannot say any more to avoid spoilers, but so much to love about this film it'll be hard to not yell some from the rooftop!",negative
180,"Story is balanced - contains multiple dark topics and dark events but it has strong comedy vibes too. And finally, a movie where trailer didn't betray all the story, it has even some magic in it. Recommended to all fans of kung fu and to all fans of Harry Potter.",negative
181,"The story is like trying to say a lot but all over the place. It doesn't have any genuine nature to Eastern films, it clearly shows American crowd appeasing film made just to say to Asians, ""Look we did film for you by casting all Asians and few others and an amazing story"". It fails in many aspects be it from story, or acting or visuals, but they are always expert in marketing the mediocre or sometimes even worse film as good, great so on and make money.This movie didn't have heart in right place at first instance. You don't even connect to Shang Chi's character neither anyone in the other roles. It's just feels so cookedup without genuine touch of Chinese or HK films. There is no strong theme or purpose of who is doing and what for. It all feels like we are doing this to make a character for Marvel.The Marvels' usual formulaic movies are ripping off stories and many comics too, and it looks they only could touch upon few aspects of visuals in here but overall its an average or below average film. Since it's close to post pandemic times, so everyone are eager to watch, so it helped movie to shine through.This PCness of Hollywood and American culture should shove their mindset in their A@#$ and let people do make their genuine films and accept the way it is rather then poking their nose in each films to give an mixed bag approach. They ruined Mulan doing this screwed up mindset of film making approach. I'm sure they will cover it up in Eternals, but still all these super hero movies now are so junk it seems.",negative
182,"...Jackie Chan, Sandra Bullock's character ""Annie"" from Speed, a tribble (from Star Trek), Daenerys Targaryen, Robin Hood, a LOT of drugs, the ""sixth"" Beatle who left the band early to become a stage performer, a LOT more drugs and a pinch of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" together?Well, after you bring the concoction to a luke-warm temperature, you get...""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.""At first I was going to skip this movie, because it didn't look appealing to me. Then, I read a lot of good reviews for the film, so I decided to give it a chance.Note: I do not know anything about the comic book character. I generally like Marvel movies. I hate martial arts movies where people are walking on thin tree branches, etc.The first fight (between Shang-Chi's future parents) was boring to me. I thought if all the fights are like the first one, I'm leaving the theater. Thankfully, many of the fights were better.I read a lot of people liked the humor in the movie. I didn't find much humor at all. At least not the ""laugh out loud"" humor that I found with the latest Suicide Squad movie.The option for characters to speak English or not was all over the place. For example, Katy mentioned that she didn't speak Chinese very well. However, towards the end of the movie, one of the ""elders"" told her to shoot the arrow at the dragon's throat, she seemed to understand him perfectly fine.Speaking of Katy, I knew they threw her into the final battle just so she could deliver the crucial blow (with very, very little training). When the scene actually happened, I rolled my eyes.There were parts of the plot that seemed missing. Maybe I missed it while reading the subtitles at some point. I don't know. For such a long movie, I wished some aspects of the plot were a little clearer.Half way through the final battle, I just wanted the battle/scene/movie to be over.The movie isn't terrible, but I could have waited to see it on TV instead.",negative

184,"The Marvel machine continues to turn out grand entertainments with remarkable regularity. SHANG-CHI is no exception. This film mixes light drama, comedy, and action in an entertaining brew. The visual effects and art direction impress. Though the action scenes are exciting, the presence of Michelle Yeoh occasionally reminds of films where thrilling stunts and martial arts were performed without the aid of visual effects.",neutral
185,"I like, and watch quite a few, 'Asian' martial arts movies. This isn't one...sort of...but the martial arts in it is really good. Some shock to say Awkwafina has a great role and she plays it so well. Even if you only slightly like the MCU, you have to see this movie. And stay through ALL of he credits.",positive
186,One of the better marvel movies. The fathers acting was not good. Action was top tier. It was consumed by action. Some would say over-consumed.,negative
187,"Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings introduces a new Marvel Character/Avenger, and that's Shang-Chi. The way that the film introduced that character was great. Loved how the film jumps back and forth a few times to tell us about Shang-Chi's past when he was young and how or why he ended up where he is in the present day.The film had so many fight scenes that were amazing and the cinematography that was used to shoot these fight scenes made them 10x better and that's perhaps because the cinematographer of this film is Bill Pope who shot The Matrix (1999) and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (2004). You could tell for sure that there are a lot of similarities between the fight scenes in Shang-Chi and The Matrix especially that both of them had this ""kung fu"" style of fighting. Loved how sometimes during the fight scenes the ""Dutch tilt"" method was used and it was wide showing the stunning set design around.The film is also visually stunning which I'm happy to call one of Marvel's most visually stunning films. It's a treat for the eyes.The comedy in the film was so good and used very carefully in perfect times which is something that scares me whenever I watch a ""Marvel"" film. Because these films are supposed to be ""serious superhero"" films. But, when comedy is used in perfect times, the result will be perfect.Akwafina's acting was very great. Loved her character and am excited to see what her character will have in future MCU Films. Simu Liu was of course the perfect actor for this role but one thing that in my opinion he ""failed at"" are the ""emotional scenes"". This film has so many emotional scenes that discuss ""family"" and the relationship between a father and his son. I felt like Simu Liu couldn't be able to deliver that emotional feeling to the audience because his acting was bad in these emotional scenes. This brings me to Tony Chiu-Wai Leung who plays ""the father"". Leung carried the whole film in my opinion. Whenever there was an emotional scene between the father and his son, Leung was way better at expressing and showing his feelings than Simu Liu.Loved all the visual effects, they were all well made especially that the film has so many. The customs as well are great and loved how sometimes the colors represent Shang-Chi's culture like the ""football varsity jacket"" that was red and grey that Shang-Chi was wearing at the beginning of the film.I got to point out that the last 30 minutes or so of the film are one of the greatest and most enjoyable in the whole MCU.My rating is 8/10.",negative
188,"Another great Marvel origin story. Cast are all excellent especially Awkwafina in a comedic role & Ben Kingsley getting some love after his undeserved trouncing as ""The Mandarin"" in Iron Man 3 (i liked it). Marvel have another winner on their hands.",positive
189,"The stories which follow warriors who have to confront a hard past, filled with pain and remorse, are intriguing to see how the main characters are getting self confident on both physically and psychologically. As the main characters through their body language they express on the way they are feeling emotionally, especially during the fight sequences, which initially their body language might be insecure to immediately lose their fight; but after the main characters have learnt in what they are looking for, their body language becomes more self confident and especially stronger, to even be ready to face their final battles to be often much intense than the first ones. The filmmaker Destin Daniel Cretton seems interested to explore this theme, by developing a new movie for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this time about the character Shang-Chi. After a long time of work, in 2021 came out Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings by Destin Daniel Cretton, with Simu Liu, Awkwafina, Meng'er Zhang, Tony Leung, Fala Chen and Michelle Yeoh. The movie's plot: The martial artist Shaun/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), who in once has been trained to be an assassin, has left his past on the back to live in his own life in San Francisco; until his father Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung), who is in the command of the Ten Rings organization, has reunited him and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) to search something essential in the village Ta Lo, where Ying Li (Fala Chen) the mother of Shang-Chi and Xialing guarded in once. The movie has captured a lot of attention, by surprising the audience, the critics and the fans of Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, as the story went in a different direction than what the previous movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have gone, even the movie has maintained some of the established superhero elements in the cinematic universe. Especially for the way the movie explores the Asian culture, by using the Chinese mythological creatures, to let the audience feel emerged in another culture, through the settings and the colors to be expressive on the emotions of the story and on the feeling of the characters. The story gets much expressive in the emotions of the characters, through the choreography in the fight sequences, where their movements and their steps represent the way of how they will confront their greatest battles, both internally and externally. The production designer Sue Chan has elaborated the settings with specific details, to be expressive through the mythological look to the let the eyes of the audience be emerged in the story; at the same time, some of the most specific settings are filled with colors, which make them much powerful of the emotions and of the meanings on some of the most crucial moments of the story. The costume designer Kum Barrett has created costumes which fit with the shape and the colors of the characters, as most of them have been specifically elaborated to fit in their movements during the fight sequences; especially when the costumes fit with the body language of the characters, which can be felt without distorting their movements. The cinematographer William Pope has captured in every single camera movements as well as in every single angle shots, with the help of the lightnings, the shadows and the colors, some of the most essential shots of the scenes, which make some of the most essential moments of the story unforgettably poetic and mythological. The editors Elísabet Ronaldsdóttis, Nat Sanders and Harry Yoon have created the narration's rhythm in a clear way on how the story will be told from the beginning to the end, without distorting the narration of the story and by using essential footage which create the movie. The visual effects have been specifically elaborated to create some of the most spectacular scenarios of the story, in every single details of pixels to let the eyes of the audience be emerged in the story; especially through the settings, colors, lightnings and shadows, which make them mythologically spectacular. The score by Joel P. West has been elaborated to be more close to the Asian culture, in every single musical notes to balance the emotions of the characters; as well as some of the most essential moments of the story, to blend with the scenes without distorting the narration's rhythm nor in some of the most epic moments of the movie. Simu Liu did an excellent performance as Shaun/Shang-Chi, a martial artist who was in once trained as an assassin, to later on get away from the dramatic past to live in his own life; until his father Xu Wenwu has reunited him and his sister, where Shang-Chi has to confront his past to slowly become much confident with himself. Awkwafina did an excellent performance as Katy, the best friend of Shang-Chi who has no idea about his past, until she will come with him and learns more about him; initially she shows herself to be insecure and goofy, but since she has been involved with the mission of Shang-Chi she will become stronger internally as well as physically. Meng'er Zhang did an excellent performance as Xialing, the sister of Shang-Chi and the daughter of Xu Wenwu, who shows herself to be a strong person on the outside, but on the inside she is much vulnerable, especially because of the past which has tormented her; until she will become much confident, to be even closer to Shang-Chi and she will be the one who will later on change something important, in a crucial moment of the story. Tony Leung did an extraordinary performance as Xu Wenwu, the leader of the Ten Rings organization and the father of Shang-Chi and Xialing, who tries to be a good father for how much the love he has on them both; but since something tragic has happened, he has returned of what he used to be in once, especially to search in what he is looking for. Fala Chen did an extraordinary performance as Ying Li, the wife of Xu Wenwu and mother of Shang-Chi and Xialing, who will be seen often times in the flashbacks for an important reason; she has been the reason to have a family with Xu Wenwu, as in the flashbacks Ying Li has taught some of the most essential lessons to Shang-Chi. Michelle Yeoh did an excellent performance as Ying Nan, the guardian of Ta Lo and the aunt of Shang-Chi and Xialing, who will be the one to explain what is Xu Wenwu looking for and she will be also the one to teach Shang-Chi, Xialing and Katy, with the help of the rest of the village, how to become much confident with themselves. Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings is an unexpectedly surprising movie, which uses some different elements from the previous Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, it is one of the best movies of the cinematic universe as well as one of the best movies of 2021.",positive
190,"What do you call a man on a mission to keep his family safe? What do you call a man who just wants to fit in where he belongs? A new kind of hero. We have entered into Phase 4 of the greatest movie franchise in movie history. We have seen battles, we have seen so many Marvel characters in the last 12 years come to life, but this new kind of hero comes to us by surprise.Who here knows about Shang-Chi? I just learned about on Friday and from what I read - I can honestly tell you his story is one for the history books. I can't give out the whole movie to you or anything to spoil the movie, but this movie was different from the other movies in the MCU.I was in shock from the very beginning to the end, there were a lot of ""easter eggs"" linking all the way back to Tony Stark, oops, I think I said a little too much, but I will say this -
This movie defied everything in the natural and supernatural realm of not only the physical, but the soul. It dives deep into the soul of a person, and that is what Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is all about.I have to give a huge shout-out to Simu Liu - like I said before - I have never heard of Shang-Chi up until recently, but he gave the role a new meaning and a new identity.Now without giving too much away, with every Marvel movie, there are some credit scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. That's all I am saying.So in essence - I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: 11 stars.",negative
191,"I enjoyed this more than Black Widow. Black Widow wasn't bad, but when you've had two great Spider-Man's, a fantastic Captain America or two and the amazing Infinity war....well Black Widow just seems meh.But why are we talking about that when now we have Shang Chi.To give it's complete title that would also include the legend of the 10 rings.Overall I enjoyed this but the pity is the weak and predictable ending. The obligatory 2 end credit scenes are also there.Where it excels is the first 2/3rds. It has a very Spider-Man feel to it in the sense of easy going humour. The fight scenes are great....although some seem simply contrived to show off martial arts being performed in a different to the usual place martial arts films usually have their fights.....but then Jackie Chan films have been doing this stuff decades ago. Still fun though.There are some neat touches involving referencing characters introduced in other Marvel films which adds a different dimension and pleases some of the fan base.But ultimately, it all winds up like a million other big budget fighting the monster in the end of film blockbuster. Lots of bangs, exposition, non sensical OTT fight scenes and a little perplexing how we even got here.It suffers from sugar coated neatness.After all, this film starts well with some dark tones along the way but ends up being too neat. Like a moral compass advert for how ideally one's life can be redeemed by not being a dick for a few seconds.Still as popcorn movies go (and boy have we missed them these past two years), this is perfectly serviceable.Nowhere on par with the two recent spideys. In fact, I'ld say if you can hold out till it gets to Disney+ next month (October 2021), watch it then for nothing more as it's included with your subscription.I must say, Marvel (Disney) are churning out same ole same ole....nothing new whereas DC are knocking it out the park.....first with the excellently unsettling Joker and the recent The Suicide Squad. With The Batman possibly delivering on it's Riddler promise, we may have a shift back to DC in terms of power balance. This is surprising to me as DC have churned out some proper crud over the years.I wish the scripts pushed the envelope by telling interesting, engaging and intelligent stories.Unfortunately, there really is nothing original or revealing about Shang Chi. It's a safe film. Fun but ultimately forgettable.",negative
192,"The Marvel come back with typical hero villains movie with some suprised. There is nothing new in story but the movie is cocktail of good action , comdey, family darma and superb eye chaching visuals. Love it.",positive
193,"Totally unpopular opinion here and I might be the only one, but I really didn't like it; even going into it with no expectations. I wasn't too keen on the movie in the first place, but I was swayed by everybody who watched it and said it was brilliant. What a mistake. I felt the movie was incredibly dull, generic, utterly cliched and stereotyped. Crap characters, formulaic plot, and not even all that funny. As soon as the movie opened with a Chinese battle banner and the twang of guzheng notes, I knew it would be bad. The action and fight scenes aren't even all that great: they relied way too much on CG. I feel like the action was nothing special: Jackie Chan (and Yuen Wah whom you'll see in Shang Chi) in his hey-day produced way better action and fights without CG. Back when The Matrix first came out, that was mind-blowing action that Western audiences haven't seen before. If you've seen any number of Hong Kong martial arts movies you'll know what I mean. The third act of the movie was a total rip-off of the last battle in How to Train Your Dragon. Also an absolute waste of great actors like Michelle Yeoh who was given nothing to do, she practically dialled in her part. Positives though: Tony Leung. He's the one redeeming grace of this terrible and lazy movie.",negative
194,Shang-Chi is action/fantasy cinema peaking. It is beautiful and so well choreographed I can hardly wrap my head around it. It is powerful and elegant and strong. This was a very awesome world to walk into for 2 hours. Cannot wait for the next installment.,positive
195,"I'm a Singaporean so I do know I'm probably not the target audience for this movie. Nonetheless, it's Marvel so I got to watch it.Pros:
1. I like the special effects when they fight2. Many Chinese dialogues in the movie. I'm the only one laughing in the cinema though. Especially when Tony Leung said ""I ate more salt than you ate rice"", that's exactly what my parents always say.Cons:
1. Too much exposition. The dead mother starts it off, then Shang-Chi to Katy, then Tony Leung, then Michelle Yeoh.2. The costumes that the people in Talo wear are ugly. C'mon, just because they're Chinese doesn't mean they wear red colour like it's Chinese New Year everyday.3. Why does Xia Ling's hairstyle look so ugly? It's a straight fringe, mushroom head hairstyle. The actress' real life hair looks pretty. Are they trying to make her look ""uglier"" to align with Liu Simu?4. Shang-Chi is supposed to be in his 20's? Too bad Liu Simu looks his real life age.5. Archery scene ripped off The Hobbit. What are the odds that Awkwafina's arrow is the one that pierced the dragon?6. Awkwafina is a Mary-Sue. So she is not only smart (Berkeley), good driver, she also mastered archery in 2 days. I would have liked to see a training montage and she improving, not getting a bullseye from the start. She is not relatable to Asians. Asians hate other Asians who are just effortlessly talented.7. No suspense. We are not scared of our main characters ever dying.8. It's strange how Marvel don't want Katy and Shang Chi to be dating but hints at it, like they are intimate than platonic friends. Guess Marvel doesn't do romance well.",negative
196,"I'm from Hong Kong. Having watched Crazy Rich Asian, I went into this having very low expectations. But it really surprises me how good it is. The storyline is intense. Love the Mandarin dialogue. The amazing natural scenery. Tony Leung's charisma. The occasional humor. Kitty and Shaun's pure friendship. It's kinda empowering and touching to see people I watched growing up in a Marvel movie being able to accurately represent our own culture.Wish Awkwafina could have learnt and spoken Mandarin tho.",negative

199,"This movie has a lot of balance and solid chemistry. I thought there would be the excess kung-foolish and overacting but only a little.

They did copy a bit from Nobody, Speed and the Jaws character from James Bond but it was OK.You won't be disappointed.",negative

203,"10/10An excellent story superbly told. Flourished with colour, visual spirit & awesome fight sequences.A diverse cast who each shine in their roles amongst a load of action, moments of humour, bits of drama & a tad of romance.Some of the best action scenes I have seen since Captain America & The Winter Soldier. Albeit a lot of difference between the two fighting styles they still stand out individually.Go & see this movie in Gold Class in a recliner with a snack or two. Highly recommended. Even for those that do not follow the Marvel franchise. It is worth watching for the story, action & humour.",positive
204,"This martial arts film was stunning. The action choreography was a visual treat, all of the cast was tremendous (Simu is a star and Tony is a legend), I loved as an Asian how it brought forth our culture without it feeling forced, and I loved the central story of family.

206,"If you are like me, from the previews and ads you thought this was a Kung Fu movie about a son rebelling against his crime lord father and the father sends men to force him to return and make him take over as the next leader of the criminal empire. Not an awful plot but not that original either. That is absolutely NOT what this movie is about. I love and hate that Marvel's trailer seldom give anything away and I am glad they are doing it again. That is not at all what this movie is about and I will not spoil anything.The performances are good, the story is good and while not complicated, it keeps your interest. Funny parts, touching parts, action parts, it is overall just a good movie that was enjoyable to watch. It is not one of the best Marvel movies but it is a solid one and worth seeing in the theater.",negative
207,"Shang-Chi is fantastic, it's like a Bruce Lee movie meets a Marvel movie. One of the better Marvel movies. I love that they brought back Ben Kingsley to play Trevor, which he was one of my favorite characters in this movie and it is fixing his character as the Mandarin in Iron Man 3. I love that Ben Kingsley knows that most people didn't like him as the Mandarin. The insistence Planet of the Apes is played by real Monkeys is hilarious. I love the Mandarin in this movie he was my favorite character in this movie besides, Morris, Morris is the best character ever. Morris is great. The Mandarin in this movie is one of my favorite Marvel villains ever. The Ten Rings are very interesting. The bus scene at the beginning is awesome. The opening scene was also quite good. The fighting and the choreography is very well done. The dragons are very cool looking and them fighting was cool. It was nice to see Wong in this and it was nice to see him fight the Abomination. The action scenes are really cool and Simu Liu is great as Shang-Chi. I really like his character a lot and his acting is quite good. I really like the plot, it is simple but I really enjoyed it. Meng' er Zhang is good as Xialing as well. My biggest flaw is Awkwafina, she isn't as bad in this as she was in Raya and the Last Dragon and she is funny in this some of the time but I just don't think I like her very much. It will be cool to see Shang-Chi return in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. I really enjoyed this and it was one of the better Marvel movies.",positive
208,At first I thought this was gonna be a okay ish movie but it's not it's actually a good movie and the story is good the action is great and awkwafina is the best... It's fun to actually see a new and more powerful hero in the universe and who is funny like seriously he's funny and the action choreography is great because those punches damn those were some real punches and kicks... This Movie is great and it's marvel so no doubt there go watch it!...,positive
209,"As far as superhero movies retreading the same ground over and over like a pizza slicer struggling to cut through a dull crust, particularly in the current climate of overdone and overrated Marvel movies, Shang-Chi stands on its own as a very fun and endearing film. It takes you on a rollercoaster from humble jokes between friends to fighting brutes on a bus to eventually the epic battle you expected. Compared to some Marvel movies which are now feeling to make care about who I'm supposed to be cheering for in the first place, Shang-Chi is a much more likeable and worthy movie.In carrying out this formula, I think the movie does it perfectly. And I came to like the characters enough to be invested and enchanted by the events. The Chinese flavour of the movie helps to give it more rhythm and depth, at least on the surface level.Still, at the end of the day, this is another overbudgeted blockbuster action movie which makes less sense the further along you watch. Given how tight the first half of the movie is, I did find myself taken out of it by the insertion of Trevor Slattery and the obligatory ""cute little critter that knows everything"" moment. And while the inevitable final battle was very well done and exhilarating, it still exchanged logic and gravity for another slog through a chaotic battlefield of good versus evil. I also wished that Shang-Chi's father would start to make sense by the end of the movie, because he seemed enigmatic and layered at the beginning but came across as a stereotypical tyrant dad by the end.So overall, I'd say this movie is definitely worth a watch (and worth the hype) in the sea of superhero movies. It leads the pack in that bunch, but doesn't stray from it - for better and worse.",negative
210,"Ten Rings or is it Ten Bracelets? I will leave the research for you and the Marvel fans debate, and how accurate this movie is to the orignal comics. Focusing on this movie I must say it was flat right through until we get to the magical lands. Cultural mythical accuracy is sadly pushed aside by the writers and animators to retain a very standard plot. Characters' poor dialogues didnt help but the odd joke rarely did succeed. And I was very disappointed that there was a very poor attempt to capture the classical and contemporary Kung Fu element in the fights - it was limited and opportunity largely missed. If this movie was not apart of the next grandeur Marvel phase, I would have not be surprised to see another attempt/ reboot in five or ten years.",negative
211,"If you don't know Tony Leung's influence in the Chinese movie industry, I recommend watching Grandmaster by Wong Kar-Wai (probably one of the best Chinese movie in this century). The story itself really didn't impress me, because every Marvel movie sort of has a pattern by now, and the script writers are basically replacing different characters into corresponding spots. However, I do get Marvel's intention of enlarging their superhero community to outside of the western world through the huge amount of mandarin conversation. Also, as a typical Chinese, the movie's theme of parent's expectation colliding with the new generation's rebellion, really resonates with me. Specifically, Tony Leung's depiction of an adherent, reserved, and occasionally ruthless father is one biggest reason I gave this film a 7. Talk about character, I truly don't appreciate the performance of our protagonist: I think the long and dull middle section describing Shang's mother's death is simply trying to waste time and cover up the fact that this character has no soul. Aside from that, the actions scenes are pretty well-done, especially the starting due between Wenwu and Shang's mother. Go watch Grandmaster, it has better fight scenes of true martial artists.",negative
212,"First thing first is the cast in Shang-Chi is excellent. Every performance is great and the chemistry between Shang and Katie is excellent. I am so glad the movie did not create a forced love-interest plot between the two friends. A few of the action sequences are good and better than what we received in Black Widow. The bus fight scene in the first third of the movie in particular is a standout.45 minutes into the movie when Shang-Chi is reunited with his father I was bored beyond belief until the last act of the movie. The film switches gears and continuously dumps exposition on the audience. Everything from here becomes the predictable hero needs to accept his true self story we have seen a million times. Which is a shame because the first act of the movie seemed so fresh from what we typically get with MCU movies. The fight in the last act, while entertaining, are the typical CGI mess found in marvel movies. The one on one between Shang and his father was genuinely emotional, but once you add all the CGI dragons/monsters it becomes a mind-numbing bore.Another thing that bothers me is the character development. Excellent performances aside none of the characters go through any deep growth. The story plays out exactly how you would expect with training montages, green screen vistas and humor ruining any moments of tension. For example, Katie seems to be unnecessarily dragged into everything, learns archery in a few hours, survives a vicious battle and hits the monster right in the neck from who knows how far away. It makes my eyes roll into the back of my head thinking about it. The same thing can be said about Shang's sister. The heart wrenching conflict between her and Shang is quickly resolved and there is no character development for her. It's all nonsense and I need a little more substance with my flashy action.All my gripes aside I was entertained in spurts watching Shang-Chi because of the chemistry between it's stars and some decent action scenes. Which makes it all the more frustrating that is falls into the typical MCU formula after it's first act. Marvel take some freaking risks with your story-telling please!",positive
213,"Shang Chi and the Legend of the 10 Rings delivers a majestic adrenaline filled experience, incorporating the perfect formula to a Marvel film ( Great plot, action, comical relief, and flirting with a love interest).

218,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a prime example of consumability over creativity. Because of its formulaic nature, Shang-Chi will be indulged by many and revered by few. Everything about the script can be predicted and, by design, feels similar to its MCU predecessors. Technically, Shang-Chi seems crafted by a board room rather than specialized artists. The direction is indistinguishable, the production design is sterile, and the effects are ambitious but tonally incompatible. There are occasional visual delights but the cinematography is often executed for efficiency over artistry. None of this is necessarily upsetting but it gives Shang-Chi a bland undertone. Ultimately, this movie is competent and universally inoffensive but lacks genuine excitement or freshness.On the positive side, the cast elevates the material. Awkwafina feels perfectly placed, Tony Leung Chiu-wai brings respectability, and Simu Liu is both likable and impressive in his choreography. Some fight scenes are fun, especially Simu Liu's first battle. That fight, in particular, is the most engaging part of the film and feels like a slightly new dynamic for the MCU. Unfortunately, that is all overshadowed by Disney's calculated monotony, leaving Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings to be another forgettable step in Disney's long line of safe bets.* Writing: 5/10

Jackie Chan films
Bruce Lee films
Doctor StrangeNote: as I always say Marvel and DC films can really only be compared to one another, within their own segment of the movie industry. But even if I were to compare ""Shang-Chi"" to any other film, it would have been a 9/10.A perfect Marvel movie. Trust me, I've watched all 25 of them and the only Marvel films that come close to the richness of story, character development and sheer epicness of Shang-Chi are Doctor Strange, Thor Ragnarok and the last two Avengers. The film perfectly balances story and character development with action scenes so that throughout the whole two hours you never get tired of neither. There are no unnecessary filler scenes, there aren't any 40-min long scenes explaining the childhood background of the main character you sometimes see in such films; the flashbacks of the past are smartly intertwined as short clips within the overarching main story. The fights are absolutely amazing, obviously inspired by Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee moves (with a pinch of Kill Bill). The story is as deep and as personal as it can get for a Marvel film (honestly better than most drama films nowadays); and some scenes are as epic and vast as the final battles in Endgame or the last Hobbit movie. This is what Mulan and Raya should have looked like. And the great thing is that it doesn't rely on any of the previous Marvel movies whatsoever - a fully standalone project with completely new characters.You must watch it in a theater if you can.",positive
225,"They certainly picked the right director for this film; he seemed to understand that this script has a plot with too many generic elements and characters that are just serviceable.

I had heard that the movie was mediocre and was originally apprehensive, but went ahead with it after one of my friends said that he enjoyed it. I would have missed it, had it not been for the chance encounter with Anushka (as I had not gotten my protein at the Fitness Park stall)I am glad I took his advice and met her.The movie has a storyline that is believable with the motivations of the villain very realistic. The poor guy only wanted to relive his glory days with his family (kind of like the kingpin in ""Spiderman-Into the Spiderverse""). He was holding on to the emotion for longer than intended. Tony Leung is a spectacular actor and portrays an immense amount of emotion through his eyes. It was a pleasure to watch his scenes
Awkwafina breathes happiness into every scene that she is a part of.Michel Yeoh really shows to us what a mature actor looks like.But the one who takes the cake is Ben Kingsley. His scenes, especially the one where he describes his motivation for becoming an actor are gold.Maybe a movie on an Indian Marvel superhero off the comics Paras Gavaskar (the Jain mutant who practices non-violence but want to stop evil), Dinesh Deol (an engineer capable of psychokinesis) or Paras Gavaskar, Shakti Haddad (the brilliant expert in genetics who can locate mutants, and manipulate nervous systems) is not too far.",negative
230,"The film has some of the most engaging fight scenes of any Marvel movie that came before, courtesy of the late Brad Allan (Kingsman). They feel so fluid, stylish and clear. It was perfect.The Asian representation is also a welcome addition to the Marvel Universe. They've done it successfully before with African Culture in Black Panther and here, it's just as good. Who knows what this might bring to the Comic Book Genre in the future? Maybe we could get a proper Cassandra Cain and Lady Shiva adaptation?Unfortunately, the comedy here is bad, though not as bad as Black Widow. There is one moment though, where the comedy ends up being the worst in the MCU. On a plane, Shang Chi recalls his past to Katy and we are treated to engaging flashbacks. The drama and emotion are there.......and then the stewardess interrupts them by asking if they want either vegetarian or beef, killing the mood completely. It's those moments that I hate the most in the entire MCU that kill off any potential drama, moments like Gamora kicking Starlord in Avengers Endgame, the destruction of Asgard being played for laughs in Thor Ragnarok, etc.The pacing is kind of slow.The character development is also a problem as we don't really see enough development of Shang-Chi himself, as he's sidelined in favor of Katy or Shang-Chi's sister. He does get some development but it's not enough.On the positive side though, the acting is good, it's well cast, it's well shot, and we finally got an actual Mandarin but that's about it.",negative

232,"Right from the start I realised that the plot structure and storyline was very standard and repetitive. It's seen in many other action/superhero films. But as the action kicked in, I was still invested. It's a very fast paced movie with some new action sequences we haven't seen in the mcu yet, as well as some good comedic moments. The choreography for the action is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Very long cuts show all the action without quick cuts after every move someone takes. It's also a very beautiful film I thought in terms of scenery and colours. Music was also great, epic score and some killer songs. Definitely check out the soundtrack. But as the film entered its long third act, the ending was very underwhelming. We are being thrown at with so much stuff in a short period of time, so the reveals of some things and actions aren't as interesting as they should of been. But the film has opened up even more possibilities for what's to come in the mcu timeline, so make sure to stay for those credits scenes. But even someone who hasn't seen any or a few mcu films can watch this as it's a good standalone film. They may not understand a few things that characters talk about regarding previous events but I could assume that they'd still be invested. Overall, a solid entry for our new character Shang-Chi in the mcu, as well as having some awesome action, funny moments and eye popping miss en scene.",negative
233,"This movie's biggest strength is the action. It is so well choreographed and so well captured in camera that it is unlike any movie I've seen. That aside, the characters are solid and give depth to the family dynamic at the heart of the story. Where it fumbles is in the third act that feels like it contrasts a lot that it tried to set up in order to have an over the top fantastical element to the show. Overall very enjoyable and is probably the most appealing Marvel movie since Black Panther.",negative
234,"This had so much potential that got sadly wasted.The few fight scenes in the first half were better in quality compared to the usual Marvel quick cut edited ones. They were mildly reminiscent of the Matrix fights( The intro to the Shangchi theme music even sounded suspiciously similar to Furious Angels from Matrix Reloaded and made me miss the Matrix films more)However, anything positive about the film ends in the first half only with the second half culminating in a bloated CGI mess that is the hallmark of almost all Marvel movies. In fact, between Shangchi and Black Widow, I'd say the latter featured much better visual effects which would have looked better on the big screen than this. Shangchi would have been a more apt as a direct to video release.)It didn't also help that the lead actor was a complete void of charisma.Honestly, I am just going to watch some Jackie Chan movies now to now to help deal with the kung fu cravings this movie initiated in me but failed to deliver.",negative
235,"Not gonna lie I had fewer expectations; but since it's marvel studios, things turned out to be a lot better than I expected. Action sequences with martial arts are enjoyable and jaw-dropping. The cinematography, camera work, editing, and BGM are impressive so are the performances. Though not much of an exceptional storyline but will keep you invested throughout. Highly recommended and a great reason to get back to the theatre again! ❤",negative
236,"A little Disney goes a long way, and much of this film is pure Disney. It's alright but not great. There's the usual Disney type story of love and loss. Good parent/bad parent and estranged siblings. There's the usual 'cutesy' banter between lead and sidekick and the (very) familiar dynamic between same. There's some very Pokémon looking animals and also some creatures that look like they came straight out of the World of Warcrafts bestiary. It's very samey and is obviously just a setup for future Marvel/Disney outings. My enthusiasm is staring to wane for this type of thing. Endgame seems so long ago, and it's doubtful if we'll ever see something so monumental from this company again.",negative
237,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Seven Rings tells the story of a young man named Xu Shang-Chi who has to confront his past after confronting an organization run by his dad, Xu Wenwu. After obtaining the Ten Rings, Wenwu is given immortality and the power to overthrow governments through different times, but he falls in love with a woman from the village in a magical forest. After Shang-Chi's mom's death, Wenwu wants to find a way to revive her in the village, but Shang-Chi and his sister need to stop him and his army from causing further destruction.As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew that Shang-Chi was a film I had to see. Everything in the film was right up my alley. Martial Arts, dragons, other strange creatures, cool visuals and magic. The fact that this was a Marvel film did not really cross my mind. This looked like the perfect kind of movie see on the big screen. How does it stack up to the other Marvel films?The story to Shang-Chi is pretty typical when it comes to adventure films like this. What makes it work is that it focuses on building the characters throughout the film and giving the right balance of action and development for the film. It also helps that there is less humor here than in most Marvel films. It takes itself much more seriously as the origin story of Shang-Chi. That being said, the comedic moments here are really funny. They are perfectly timed for the most part and they are clever. The pacing is pretty solid too. It is not too fast nor too slow. The world-building is more vast than I thought it would be. There are creatures, powers, weapons and magic everywhere here as well as a magical forest. It all fits in nicely to the story. My only complaint about the story is that Xialing could have used more development or screen time. She has less to do than the other main characters and I really wanted to know more about her and how she built the underground fighting ring. Overall, the story is good.The performances are great and they elevate the characters. You can tell how excited Simu Liu was for this movie. He shows his passion in every scene he is in. Not only does he do great with the dialogue and the reactions, but he is a great fighter too. He was perfect for the role and he came off as a very natural protagonist who just wants to reunite with his family, but do the right thing. Shang-Chi is also a good character because he learned to be a good fighter without the rings, but not to the point where he was invincible. The movie also has Awkwafina as Katy who is a fun addition that adds some lighthearted scenes for a rather dark film while still being part of the action and getting serious when she needs to. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing is quite good as well. She comes of as incredibly powerful as she commands every scene she is in. Her backstory is pretty tragic with how her father treated her. I really want to see more from her in future MCU projects because her running an underground fight club is one of the most interesting parts about this movie.Then there is Tony Leung as Shang-Chi's father, also the villain. While I still think Kilmonger and Vulture are the best MCU villains, Xu Wenwu makes for a great villain. He is one of those villains who definitely needs to be stopped and you root for the protagonists over, but you can also stop and sympathize with him. He legitimately loved his family and he started to become destructive after a tragedy in the family. It also helps that he thinks he is bringing the family together when he is actually tearing it apart further, adding an extra element of sympathy or tragedy to his character. Leung's performance makes Wenwu's character so human that I was actually rooting for him to turn good by the end of the film. He makes him not just the leader of the Ten Rings, but as a normal father raising his kids with his wife. These moments show why it is important to give villains depth in their motivations and backgrounds and it is why Wenwu makes for one of the better MCU villains.The visuals in this movie are insane. This is easily the best looking Marvel film by a long shot. It has some stunning and inventive cinematography as well as some great special effects. What really got me excited were the awesome action scenes in the film. There are plenty of martial arts fights here and they have great stunt work and camerawork making them so fun to watch. The power of the Seven Rings looks really cool and made the fights even more fun to watch. And then the climax came and gave me what I wanted... I will not say much, but it is one of the most exciting fights in the MCU. This movie also has an incredibly memorable and catchy musical theme. It is easily the best score in a Marvel film.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Seven Rings is really good. I think even people who do not like Marvel would get into this film. Not only does it have the best visuals and action of a Marvel film, but it also has a really good story with some likable and relatable characters.As usual with a Marvel film, stay through the credits.",negative

240,"Disney and Marvel have gotten to the point in their collaboration that much of their projects together seem to look and feel exactly the same. Every time a new movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes out, it seems like each filmmaker has to prove that their project is more than just another superhero movie. Luckily, the MCU's newest offering, SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS, stands on its own as a quality action film with some of the best stunt-work and visual effects of the year. The movie is not perfect, and contains some trite ""superhero"" storytelling elements that Disney movies often rely on, but director/writer Destin Daniel Cretton's clear talent behind the camera transforms every average scene into a larger-than-life sequence with high stakes for characters that are easy to invest in.The first act of the film admittedly plays out similar to many mainstream ""hero's journey"" tales -- an average joe (Shang-Chi) turns out to have a more-than-average calling and must return to his past in order to keep his father from doing evil things that might cause many innocent casualties. It seems like a combination of ideas that have all been done before. The movie is at its weakest when it sets itself up to be as interesting as the concept of the plot, but for SHANG-CHI, the gold is in the execution of this storyline.Firstly, the characters are interesting from the very start of the movie to the end, so despite the clichés the audience still cares about what happens to every character, including the fantastic villains. The comedic relief is also on point throughout, and the characters all feel personable and colorful due to the life that each actor puts into their performances. Simi Liu as Shang-Chi is a star in the making, similar to Chris Evans' turn in the first Captain America film, and casting directors all over Hollywood will likely have him near the top of their call lists after this. The performance of the film for me, however, is Tony Leung as Shang-Chi's father and the primary villain. Leung plays one of the most lived-in and memorable MCU villains since Erik Killmonger -- it is impossible not to feel sympathy for him even though it's clear that he has some serious issues with how he is dealing with his inner demons.At the end of the day, I believe SHANG-CHI will truly be remembered for the technical mastery put into the action sequences. Only time will tell if this statement remains to be true, but it struck me while watching: this film contains the most well-filmed action sequences of any live-action Marvel movie thus far. A high-stakes fight scene on a bus about 20-30 minutes into the movie made me realize that the filmmakers weren't messing around with their action: the stunt choreography is phenomenal, the visual effects and cinematography are stunning, and the action set pieces are inventive and pay homage to great Asian cinema of the past. The final 30 minutes of SHANG-CHI involve one large final battle, and it ranks as one of my favorite final fight scenes in the MCU along with Avengers: Endgame and Infinity War.SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is not perfect, especially for those looking for a complete reinvention of what it means to be a superhero movie. It adheres to many of the standards that have already been set up for the genre, but it does so in such a stylish and sleek way that it is difficult not to smile during much of the film. Cretton does a fantastic job helming this movie in a way that sets it apart from the projects that came before it, and ends up crafting the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie that I wish we had. Superhero movies may be running out of ideas, but if they continue to be crafted this well, then we should expect to see plenty more where this came from.B+",negative
241,"Don't believe the praise for this movie. Marvel fans who liked it have got to be kidding. They always trash DC movies but they liked this? I don't get it. But then that is typical coming from Marvel fans. It is not the Shang Chi I remember from the 70's comics. It would have been better if It took place in the 70's and had more of an Enter The Dragon vibe. What we get is anything but. It has some good action scenes, the best being with Shang fighting men on a bus. But then it has Ben Kingsley who was out of place in it and a furry creature called Morris that was stupid and unnecessary and should have been ommitted from the movie. It's like a furry pig with wings with no head or face that makes sounds like an Ewok or Gizmo from Gremlins. So dumb. There are some amusing moments but then I find it irritating that something funny has to be thrown in at odd moments. Like most Marvel films. Give it a break. Please. The ending is something out of a Rodan, Godzilla movie. When watching this I thought is this really a Marvel movie or a B movie from made in Japan. I did like the first half of Shang Chi. The second half was just ok. I saw it free because I had a free ticket from my club card. I'm glad I did. Even when I saw the trailer I wasn't expecting anything. I can see why. My opinion is to see this on tv. It is not one of Marvel's best. And those who praise it and say that it is are kidding themselves. Gimme a break.",negative

248,"I had a good time watching the movie, i thought it was a little slow at times and that created some pacing issues for me but it wasnt anything to bad. I thought there were some things they could've done better but overall the movie was enjoyable to watch.",negative
249,"Not bad, but not great. It was kinda like a Spider-Man movie, really. Action packed. Story was just OK. No one's winning an Oscar for the acting or the writing. They kinda mocked how ridiculous the story is at the end, which was cool tho.Actors didn't really sell it for me because most of it was CGI (really excellent CGI) so nobody ever looked like they were in any ACTUAL danger. In fact, everyone doing ""dangerous"" scenes looked pretty clearly like they were just acting concerned on demand, like background extras do. Fun to watch, but I could've waited for TV, honestly.",negative
250,"Marvel universe 4. Not watched many of them before and know nothing about this movie before watching, except Tony Leung from our Hong Kong! Plot is always similar, but the fighting on the bus is good. The last scene between the dragoon and monster is also good. And Tony is just so so so smart and handsome!",negative
251,"I'm super happy to say that Marvels newest movie outing, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", is a hilarious, action packed, CGI thrill ride and it's a fantastic one at that. After seeing ""Black Widow"" I was worried that Marvel/Disney had started shifting their focus to their very ambitious TV mini series projects and left the quality of their movies behind. I'm now confident that isn't the case. Here, sets, visuals, costumes, choreography, score, acting and directing are all top notch. Each shot feels fresh and visually stunning. Each joke and emotion land. And the action is amazing. The first big set piece involving Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) and his best friend (awkwafina), is a bus ride to work gone horribly wrong, it hooks you instantly and has you either in awe with its incredible fight choreography or laughing at the perfectly timed jokes. It really doesn't let up in either category going forward. I can't believe how much I loved the pairing of these characters, their choice to not make it romantic and I love how different and real they feel from other characters in the MCU. Often Marvels problem has been their reliance on the same personality traits for their heroes, funny jerks with over confidence or bumbling idiots thrust into power. Here the main character is naturally a good person, hes comfortable with being himself and with his best friend, when power comes to him he accepts, he never truly stops being him, he doesn't have to learn a lesson, he just rolls with the punches. Almost all of this goes to actor Simu Liu who brings an extra dose of likability to the role, along with the chemistry he shares with Awkwafina which makes their friendship believable. There's even great references, cameos and credit scenes for the fans looking for that. Of course there are problems, the biggest is the big CGI slug fest ending that plagues these types of films, when all it truly needed to do was be smaller. It's a mess of CGI at times and feels a little too big and too rushed. Characters just instantly know and understand things and accept everything with ease. It is easy to over look all this, with how much fun you'll have.",negative
252,This movie was start to finish pure entertainment and it did not disappoint. Beautiful choreography and visually stunning. O and that ending wow it was like a dance of visual effects almost mind-numbingly Beautiful like a trance hats off to everyone involved in this 100% pure entertainment.,negative
253,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the new installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It stars Simu Liu as his first lead role, slings with Akwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and the great Tony Leung.Ricky Gervais has said it clearly before: Actors nowadays do adventure fantasy nonsense, their job isn't acting but going to the gym and taking steroids.Shang-Chi is nothing but an ""adventure fantasy nonsense"". It features some of the most ridiculous scenes in the MCU and some awkward green-screen scenes.Simu Liu is Shang-Chi, who has a rivalry with his father (Tony Leung). Actors here don't do a bad job, but you don't really feel for the character Shang-Chi.Tony Leung is a master of acting. It's a shame we dont get more dramatic scenes with him. Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley's characters are the comic relief characters, which, every Marvel movie needs apparently.A major bragging point of the MCU movies is how they don't feel like a MCU film. But when you have ridiculous moments like those in Shang-Chi, it doesn't always work that well.",negative
254,"I watched this movie last night and it was really really epic I feel like I was in Shang chi world (Ta-Lo) was so beautiful, so many beautiful and unique creatures. I didn't expect that Shang chi would be so good and so epic like this, but sometimes the CGI it looks like not done, but it was okey cause they give us the best visual. I Was Really Proud that Niki and Rich Brian was in Shang Chi SoundtrackWhen Mandarin acting died I was really sad but when that little creature come to him, and mandarin was said ""it was acting, come on pretend to be die"" and that was so funnyThe Ending was look like Godzilla vs Kong maybe cause the monster and the monster was fighting and Shang chi weapon was so strong. And it's kinda sad cause his dad die in front of Shang chi.This movie it doesn't feels like 2 hours but it's feels like 1 hours and I really really really wanna watch this movie again so bad. I can't Wait for the sequel. Edit : And now i watched this movie again 2 times.I really recommend you to watch this movie on cinemas now!, cause you will feel like you go to Ta-Lo Shang-Chi beautiful fantasy place. And don't forget to watch those two credit scene cause the credit scene was surprising me and can't wait to see another movie from Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).",negative
255,They definitely went all out with it ... freaking beautiful.,positive
256,"I have low expectation for this one but this movie proved I am wrong. This movie exceed my expectations in all aspect. They got great heart-touching story, funny moments (a lot of funny scene. I can hear people laugh here and there. I love how Awkwafina can be both funny and beautiful at the same time, I became her fans in this movie), great costumes, moral of the story, etc.This is only my personal opinion but I think the MC is kinda flat in personality. I can't really sympathy with him. The sidekicks in this story have more interesting background or personality (for ex. Katy, the little sister/xiangling, the father) than the MC.The only downside that really disappointing is the final battle because they overuse CGI and the CGI looks like a cheap budget movie. The best fighting scene they have is the fight in the bus.",negative
257,"Good action, great visuals but slow story and weak villian.",positive
258,Amazing. My favorite marvel movie so far. Great choreography and acting. Perfect cast and non stop fun.,positive
259,"As a Chinese person living in Australia, watching Shang Chi was an uncomfortable experience. Not unexpectedly, they resorted to the tired tropes of king fu/martial arts and Eastern mysticism as if that is all Chinese culture is about. Unlike Black Panther, where they envisioned a futuristic African kingdom, Shang Chi would not be out of place in 15th-century China. It is exasperatingly unimaginative and reductive. If they were to apply the same treatment to the white heroes of the Marvel universe, we would be watching either a Western or a bunch of heroes/villains who are supremely adept at colonizing new territories, subjugating their local populace and stealing their wealth. Instead of the diversity and inclusivity that they might have intended, this feels more like opportunism/tokenism disguised as benevolence. Disney, do better.",negative
260,"The Good- This film blends all of it's genres in very nicely. It is one part martial arts. One part family drama and one part fantasy. One of the things the MCU is good at is telling stories from different genres and making them fit within the universe and this film does exactly that. This has some of the best fight sequences within the MCU. The dynamic between Shang Chi and Awkwafina's character has a very nice dynamic between the two and really play of each other. All of the characters play a part into the story and none of them really feel pushed to the side. The Villain is also one of the better ones we have in the MCU as he has these conflicting values and we see both his good and bad side. It also isn't very predictable to see what he is going to do next. Finally the director feels like they were given a lot more freedom than usual inside MCU films because of how the story is told there hasn't been many films that have been told in this sort of style or tackling these sort of issues. This movie feels like a significant film into the MCU and moving forward in the MCU which was one of my issues with 'Black Widow'. Overall it delivered everything you want from an MCU film plus some new stuff which I enjoyed.The Mixed- The humour made me laugh and I found some of it funny. But there is a lot of forced MCU humour. If you are one of them people who are tired from the quick one liners we have in the MCU then this movie is going to frustrate you.The Bad- One of the biggest problems is the MCU template in the sense that it has to have all these jokes, a massive CGI battle at the end and has to tie into the MCU in different ways. Some of the humour works in the moment but others just fell so forced.Overall Thoughts- Overall 'Shang Chi' is a exciting mix of the MCU, martial arts, family genre and fantasy. I loved the martial arts aspect but you can tell the MCU formula trying to cheapen the experience a little bit. However put it all together you get yet another MCU film that knows what's coming next. Yet not quite a top teir MCU movie. Overall I'm going to give Shang Chi a 8/10.",negative
261,"The first thing that jumps out at you here is how uneven the acting is compared to the usual Marvel movies. Actors alternate between overacting, pathos and subdued attempts at coolness. Add the usual Marvel style self-referential wink wink humor, and the obligatory 30 minute CGI showdown with purple light themed villains and monster (for the... 15th time now?), and you end up with a jarring, nauseating tonal mess of a movie.It's the same movie over and over again, same exact story beats, same pacing, same style soundtrack, same jokes, same trashy special effects laden battle at the end.They tried to gimmick things up with Kung Fu here (because that's apparently what Disney think people want to see in movies with an Asian cast), but you've seen it all before dozens of times, and better at that. The martial arts fight in public transport has been done to death (recently quite well in ""Nobody"", but also in Marvel films like Captain Marvel), and in general the fights pale against movies like Matrix, John Wick or any Jackie Chan classic.The reality is that Marvel movies feel dated and played out, with nowhere to go except from one CGI battle to the next. Maybe Marvel would be better off switching to a series format, because the movies are just reheated microwave dinners at this point.Save your money for something original.",negative
262,"Marvel does a lot right, and a good fight scene is one of them. But this movie had battles and characters that are only available in the context of this new world and this story. Despite a ""classic"" and somewhat cliche story it brought me a lot of joy. Classics are classic for a reason right? Cliches are powerful in the right light. Also the post credit scenes! Yes! Marvelllllll you did it again.",positive
263,"Film is great overrall, same story we all know but the way it told is engaging and emotional, first thing i loved in this movie is action sequence, every action scene is so damn good. The soundtrack is amazing. The characters are well written, even a smaller role is kinda memorable, vfx is great but not in high standards in final climax, its not that messy but notable, there are two credits scenes dont miss that. It does what it meant to do(entertainment). Cant wait for further mcu movies.",negative
264,"Shang-Chi is definitely not marvel's best film as with most marvel orgin stories but should be a welcome and very likeable character in the MCUThe good.The action was amazing and beautiful choreography
The editing was flawless and was shot excellently
Simu Liu and Awkwafina presented likeable character
The world buildingThe decent.The villain could have been more fleshed out
The story wasnt the greatest
The acting was....thereOverall I would say the story started out great and slowly crawled it's way to the finish lineGood movie but once again not marvel's best.",positive
265,"SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is being called ""the Asian BLACK PANTHER,"" and I think this is an inaccurate description for two reasons. First, Asian cultures have been explored in-depth by Hollywood since the 1970s at the latest, and in ways that sub-Saharan African cultures have not. But second, and more to the point, SHANG-CHI is really just a mashup of two Hollywood subgenres that have been around for quite some time: the ""ethnic discovery"" film and the ""stupid American tourist"" film.The ""ethnic discovery"" film is the more recent type and by far the more interesting, ultimately inspired by Alex Haley's famous TV miniseries ""Roots."" It documents the saga of a protagonist who learns - or relearns - about his or her heritage and embarks on a quest to fully embrace that heritage. A good example I can think of is THUNDERHEART, in which an FBI agent (Val Kilmer) comes to appreciate his father's Native American ancestry while on a case on a Lakota reservation; a more famous but fantasy-based example is STAR WARS, in which Luke Skywalker learns that he has Jedi blood. On the surface, SHANG-CHI definitely follows this pattern.Unfortunately, the movie's ""ethnic discovery"" theme is undercut by the clichés of an even older Hollywood storyline: what one film historian has dubbed the ""racial adventure film,"" but which I simply call the ""stupid American tourist film."" Common since the 1930s, this film plot follows Western (and almost always white) characters as they visit an ""exotic"" foreign land - often for purely exploitative purposes - and proceed to reveal their ignorance about the ""native"" culture. It has always been demeaning to both the ""colonizing"" and indigenous peoples, since the former are forced to make buffoons of themselves and the latter must bear the humiliation of not being taken seriously.SHANG-CHI is an ""ethnic rediscovery"" film in that two Chinese-Americans from San Francisco learn (and, in one case, relearn) about the culture of their ancestors; but it is also a racial adventure film in that they are essentially Westerners who travel to China and find themselves in the midst of a culture clash. While not white - and, in the case of the titular character, an immigrant - Shang-Chi and his girlfriend otherwise fit the role of the ""stupid American tourist"" with their unmistakably American accents, annoying use of slang, pointless pop-culture references, and wisecracking sarcasm. The twist here is that, like Kilmer in THUNDERHEART, they revert to their ""noble savage"" origins once they have traveled to an ""ethnic"" place and ""gone native.""Not incidentally, there's one more way in which SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS differs dramatically from BLACK PANTHER. While both are based on ""non-Western"" comic book sagas created by white men, BLACK PANTHER turns stereotypes about black Africans completely inside-out, giving us fantastic science fiction instead of hackneyed ""jungle"" adventure. But SHANG-CHI is just the usual ""kung pow"" hash about the Orient, presented ironically but also in a way that isn't terribly original.In fact, if there's another Marvel movie this one closely resembles, it's not BLACK PANTHER but DEADPOOL. Both combine wacky humor and serious (and even ""dark"") subject matter in a way that's very jarring and ultimately exasperating. But at least DEADPOOL felt fresh.",negative
266,"Excellent cast. Story was fine. Jokes were funny. Action was well filmed and you could see what was actually happening (snake eyes, take note). Much better than black widow.",positive
267,"I'll be brief.Clearly much effort, thought and funding has gone into this flick but it only goes to show that one can assemble all the right ingredients in a recipe and still make a meal of it.It has good action, but the live action CG is stale and the transitions always evident.It has a solid storyline, but the padding is average.It has good actors, but in support roles only.In a movie where you know the hero will ultimately triumph, it's all about how you get there.This journey was underwhelming.",negative
268,"Visually beautiful,good action sequences, great starcast but what ruined my experience was the over expectations, I went for this one after reading it's extremely positive reviews all around just like The suicide squad (even that was one was an average flick nothing else) but later turned out to be an average movie.. neither bad nor too good...",negative
269,"6 for purely martial arts entertainment.There are dozens of China-produced/financed martial arts/fantasy films where Laws of Physics-agnostic fight scenes are as implausible as the speeded up movements. However, most are either based on some ancient fable or setting, or in a police/crime drama where Chinese cities appear more modern than anything in North America.Probably also financed by China-based interests, this is a Disneyfied take on the bread-and-butter of Chinese martial arts films. The plot to draw in US audiences is to have the two young protagonists played by 1st generation N. Americans, including the off-the-wall Akwafina with her mouthy repartees and gravely vocal delivery.Apart from that, it is not particularly distinctive, with the major ""star"" casting of Michelle Yeoh who is well-known to US audiences for decades, first as a Bond ""girl"", then in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Star Trek Discovery series, and in Filthy Rich Asians. As a Malaysian, she is illiterate in any Chinese language, and learns her lines phonetically!The lead, an unknown Canadian, is competent and Awkwafina does her part to make the film ""relatable"" to the social media generation. Good CGI and opulent sets don't compensate for an otherwise ""run of the mill"" martial arts production.------------------5/10 Social significance for US audiences.As for social comment, it is high time that entertainment media fully represent the demographic reality of the US, where 6 percent of Americans are of Asian origin, but both actors and storylines are almost invisible, only as secondary characters to a White or Jewish protagonist if they are Asian-American, or only able to seek pigeonholing roles of an immigrant, shopkeeper, criminal gangster, or taciturn Eastern guru - all of whom speak English with a demented cookie voice.This movie does nothing to address the basic lack of visible integration of Asian Americans into the fabric of portrayals of TV or film. I can think only of 911, and of the former reboot of Charlie's Angels where the Asian origin of characters was neither highlighted nor subjugated.Apart from that, the multiplication of Mono-ethnocentric productions (on ""Black"" cable networks) still does not address the lack of portrayal of non-Whites in an integrated fashion - but a form of Apartheid in mass media.",negative
270,"Tony, Fala and Simu had an absolutely phenomenal performance in this fantastic movie. It's so nice to see more representation of different cultures. This movie did for the Asian community what Black Panther did for the African American community.The action scenes were one of the best of the ANY marvel movie. The choreography was by far the best in any Marvel movie. This movie felt like Ip Man with a mythical story added to it. The action was impeccable. The story was unique and wasn't very generic. I love that Simu does his own stunts too.Marvel NEVER ceases to amaze me. We need more company like this *cough cough Warner Bros and Sony cough cough*So thankful we're getting two more!",positive
271,"Great start, especially the fight choreography between Shang Chi's parents. That was sheer awesome and so was the fight in bus where we got good humour as a bonus.But then story gets dragged out and turns weird.Instead of taking us to Shang Chi's universe which is about martial arts... we are to Dr. Strange's.Dark Door, a soul-consuming monster from another realm... It was like they borrowed elements just for the hell of it.Expected so much...",positive
272,"For starters, the cinematography and the CGI are pretty nice. However that's where the positive ends.The fighting choreography is ok, not bad but not great at all. For example even Mortal Combat did it way better with way less. Also it follows the usual marvel formula of a lot of CGI in the fighting scenes, but this time they blew of the roof with it making those scenes feel completely detached from the world they're in.Concerning the characters, Shang-Chi isn't really there for most parts of the movie, taking a few steps back in his very own movie. A lot of things that other characters did in their time in the spotlight should have been done by him, there was no reason for him to not do those things. Causing him to be a neglected in his own movie, basically a background character. As for the female leads, one is just plain annoying and really serves no purpose(you'll know instantly when she appears). The other is an over-the-top strong woman actually getting most of the screentime, which don't get me wrong the actress acts nicely, but the way she is presented in the story and the way her character has come to be and is established is just unnatural and feels like she's just someone who has activated IRL-cheats, it just feels like they took a real shortcut with her character whilst there was so much they could've done to make her really likeable and immersable for you as a viewer. However the way they handled her just makes her feel like a 2D cardboard character that used cheats to max her stats.As for the story and dialogue. The story is just abyssmal, really lacking in content and feels like something a hungover student would drum up last-minute after a late night party. The dialogue feels wooden most of the time, just really unnatural and don't even get me started on the ""humor"" which is overly forced and just really bad.It feels like a movie that knows what it wants to do, but not how it wants to do that and just goes at it in a dozen ways leaving to much clutter and sidesteps for it to feel like a coherent story. If only they had chosen 1 or 2 things and stuck with them it could have been a decent flick.",negative
273,The ACTORS of this action film did NOT disappoint! I knew if it had Tony Chiu-Wai Leung and Michelle Yeoh it was going to be good! Simu Liu and Awkwafina were fantastic! They kept it traditional but also added a little modern flare to this kung-fu movie. Must see this movie IN THE THEATRE AND NOT SITTING ON YOUR COUCH!,negative
274,"That was a freakin' blast! The story is complex and interesting it fills some gaps in the MCU and simultaneously is a great origin story for the character of Shang-Chi.The whole cast is amazing, I mean there is so much chemistry between them. Simu Liu and Tony Leung are phenomenal in their respective roles. The Mandarin tho...so well created character.The movie is amazing bridge between East and West culture. There is so much to explore, much like Wakanda. The history of Shang's culture is so rich.The fight choreography is absolute kick in the gutts...in a good way. I mean this is something completely new for the MCU and they deliver it again! Everything looks so goddamn good and I can't help myself thinking about some scenes! Also, the colors, the effects, the camera work and etc. Everything is magnificent.There is humor for sure, but there is also emotional impact. This is not some bland action packed movie, it's made with heart from fans for the fans. Kudos to the director Destin Cretton!Killer soundtrack and the main song for the movie ""Run It"" fits so good with all.There are a few surprises, that were hidden from the promos and trailers and man...just wait to see them.About the credit scenes...they are two, both are good, but one of them is...SICK!For sure deserves more than one viewing in the cinema, so much story building, details, action, fun. The people who underestimated this movie will be so surprised how great is it.",positive
275,"Absolutely loved it. Must watch. Non stop action and all you can imagine in a good movie....
I am not saying any more, just watch the film and you will not be disappointed.I think I will go to the cinema at least one more time to watch it again, that how great it was.I am simply buzzing!!!",negative
276,"Although I found some of the backstory to be unnecessary, Shang Chi is a fun, action packed adventure, and a welcome Marvel newcomer. Simu Liu and Awkwafina make a great team and I look forward to seeing future adventures.",positive
277,"'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is the latest instalment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring MCU newcomers Simu Liu as the titular character and Tony Leung as 'Wenwu' and, at last, the definitive portrayal of 'The Mandarin'. Helmed by director Destin Daniel Cretton this picture injects the perfect amount of Asian culture into this enormous franchise.The cast is stellar, especially Liu who wished this role into existence years ago on social media and I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. He has brilliant on screen chemistry with co-star Awkwafina who plays 'Katy', Shang-Chi's best friend. Katy acts as the audiences lens into this world. She is just a normal person and I feel her role is pivotal in helping general audiences digest a story with this many magical elements. Thanks to Leung's performance 'Wenwu' has become one of the best MCU villains. He is the excellent blend of menacing and sympathetic with understandable motives.The fight choreography is second to none in the MCU. They linked perfectly with the set pieces created for this film. They were excellent, in particular the Bus fight scene and the final fight between Wenwu and Shang-Chi. These brilliant pieces of action were achieved through the lack of camera cuts and smooth camera movements to exhibit the skilled choreography. Along with the set pieces, the overall look of this film is stunning. There are some especially beautiful shots within the final fight scene which makes up for some of the routine Marvel tropes which this picture eventually falls into.The main themes of family and grief are incredibly heartfelt. They're told expertly through these characters and are deeply rooted in Asian culture, something this film showcases with perfection. From the Ten Rings compound to the Golden Daggers Club in Macau to the fictional land of Ta Lo, the Asian culture is always on show and this film, along with the wider MCU, benefits from it tenfold.However, this film is not as perfect as it could've been, thanks in large part to the Marvel formula which this picture falls into like many of it's predecessors. This is most apparent in the 3rd act which not only drags on for too long, but also turns into big CGI monster vs big CGI monster once again. When I believe a more grounded martial-arts style fight would've been more fitting.Overall, 'Shang-Chi' began as a breath of fresh air into this franchise, with deeply rooted themes, a gargantuan cast and stunning fight choreography until it gave in to the ordinary marvel formula which has plagued this genre since it's inception. Despite this, the future looks bright for these characters and the post-credit scene cements the titular character as an MCU mainstay for years to come.8.5/10.",negative
278,"This film is... good,... but a little disappointing.Let's start with the positives. This movie looks incredible. The Chinese elements and Asian-American influences give this film a wonderfully unique style. The fight choreography is some of the cleanest ever seen in the universe. It all looks incredible and clear, with clear lessons learned from the works of Bruce Lee. Simu Liu does an amazing job and I ADORE Shang-Chi and a character. I cannot wait to see more of him in the future.Unfortunately, the writing really lets this movie down in a lot of ways. None of the characters in the film feel like they learn or grow throughout the story, including Shang-Chi. Shang starts out as a trained fighter who loves his dad but condemns his actions and he finishes the film in the exact same spot. I similar thing can be said for his father who also feels very stagnant. Shang's sister is unbelievably one-dimensional filling in as the badass woman type with no further depth beyond her painful American accent. The comic relief characters very much overstay their welcome and become grating as things go on. This is very apparent for the return of Trevor who should have remained nothing more than a 10-second cameo.The story itself is very messy and cliche. At the beginning of the film, we are presented with an amulet that is treated as being very important but disappears at the end of the first act. Shang's journey isn't really motivated with himself, but through an urge to stop whatever his father is doing. It all feels very hallow.I appreciate what this movie will do for Asian representation, but am underwhelmed by it simply as a film on its own, not unlike that of Black Panther.",neutral
279,"Awkwafina should not be the most interesting part of your $150 million kung fu movie.She wasn't great (sometimes she was a bit annoying, to be honest), but everyone else was forgettable. Shang-Chi himself was the generic ""slacker with potential"" character with no personality. And he was a live wire compared to the rest of the cast. Aside from Awkwafina, the others seemed to have picked one emotion (either stoic, angry, stern, or ""wise"") and stuck with it.Wait a minute, I forgot about Ben Kingsley. His appearance was a nice surprise (I think), but he was a wacky Disney animated movie sidekick with an awful-looking CGI pet monster (who was also a wacky Disney animated movie sidekick).Shang-Chi strikes me as an American-friendly martial arts movie. Not that I'm an expert on kung fu movies, but I've watched enough movies (including several Marvel movies) to know a factory-made action flick when I see it. The movie is very watered down.There was, for instance, no effort involved in developing a plot or telling a story whatsoever. It's almost the exact same plot as the CW's Kung Fu series. Family vs. Family.I wanted to enjoy the fight scenes (I can tell that a lot of effort was put into them), but everything looked fake. Obvious special effects mixed with artificial movie sets. The final battle was two giant cartoons wrestling each other.As a matter of fact, almost every scene in the movie was covered in computer graphics.I didn't hate the movie. I can see other people liking it. But I was bored most of the time.",negative
280,"Mannnn... this movie is good.Let me... just say.. first of all.. OMG THE FIGHTS! THE ACTION! OH.. MY.. GOD. Marvel did it again after having a slight setback with the just okay black widow movie. This movie has the best fight scenes I've seen since the raid films. The fights are so well choreographed but also fast paced and filmed to perfection. The bus fight is incredible!!!!! The fight in the beginning between the mandarin and the mother.. wow wow wow...
OKAY Back to reality. This movie does have flaws. First of all the pacing in like the 3/4rd of the film is a tat slow. The score honestly is weak. Might be my theater but there were moments where the score had to make me feel something and (credits to the movie itself that it let me ) i had to do that all by myself.The plot sometimes leans to a pretty basic plot, but because of the great screenplay it works.Cinematography was amazing. The acting was good. And the special effects were very good. One thing that I have to admit. Game of thrones kind of spoiled us with the design of .. a particular mythical creature so... that won't look as great as it could've been but still very good.But man the fights were incredible.. the camera work was so good. Fluent movements but fast and I could see EVERYTHING. After snake eyes I thought I would never see a good martial arts movie again considering how average that was.Thank you, shang chi. You made my night.9 out of 10. Welcome back marvel.",negative
281,"Marvel recruits indie director Destin Daniel Cretton of Short Term 12 fame to bring the character of Shang Chi to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Sadly, an abundance of familiar tropes, messy visual effects and a lead character who is overshadowed both by performance and development from the villain leads to a painfully average film.Shang Chi follows all the needed and formal tropes to make a surprisingly dull origin tale. Simu Liu is fine in the role of Shang Chi who must challenge his father from unleashing a terrible foe.Tony Leung makes his English language debut as Wenwu, a far more compelling and intriguing character then his son, with Leung giving a refreshingly subtle performance.Awkwafina is fine as Shang Chi's friend Katy but her generic arc lets her down. Meng'er Zhang plays Shang Chi's sister, Xialing who is also far more interesting then her titular brother but lacks the screentime to really be fleshed out.The ensemble do solid work with notable standouts being Michelle Yeoh, Fala Chen with a very funny Ben Kingsley and a much welcomed Benedict Wong.The film soars during the rather intimate scenes between Wenwu and his wife Leiko but these scenes are soon traded for large scale battles with ugly green screen backgrounds.Aside from some intriguing post credits scenes, the film leaves you wanting more. It's a shame that Marvel didn't allow Cretton to make use of his indie sensibilities and resigned him to a basic origin tale that is painfully average.",positive

It's all over the place!Here's a little tip for the people who wrote this: pick a tone and stick with it!Good CGI and very good action set pieces. Hence three stars instead of one. Other than that - this is the normal generic Marvel phase 2 dross.Oh, and Awkwafina is unwatchable! She's more like an irritant than an actress.P. S. I'm incredibly suspicious of the o.t.t. Positive reviews this film is getting on here. Bots?",negative
288,I'll start by saying I'm generally pretty sick of the glut of superhero movies that have dominated blockbusters for so many years now. Marvel in particular have gotten to the point where I feel many of their movies are just the same old things rehashed over and over.So I wasn't expecting much from this superhero film based on a character I'd never heard of. What a pleasant surprise it was. A movie with interesting characters that had plenty of depth. A superb cast good enough that even Michelle Yeoh's usual outstanding performance didn't upstage everyone else. Beautiful visuals like you'd expect from some of the better recent chinese films rather than a Marvel film. And the action and visual effects didn't disappoint.Well worth seeing on the big screen to truly appreciate.,negative
289,"This movie really surprised me. Def one of my favorite marvel movies ever, it's worth a watch.",positive
290,"Shang-Chi has great special effects and a compelling storyline but the script doesn't get too emotionally deep. This is one of the major liabilities of trying to tell a good story in about 2 hours. You simply can't because it takes time for viewers to develop care, concern, and emotional attachment to characters. So, what is best told in 2 hours? Robust short stories with excellent special effects that can only be enjoyed on the big screen. To this end Shang-Chi delivers in loads. The action is fast and the camera work while a bit dizzying captures the action very well. The only major issue I had with the plot is with the monsters that the heroes are fighting against. If you watch Chinese wuxia or xianxia dramas, you know that stories involving magical beasts are always based on Chinese mythology, Taoism, Buddhist, Chinese folk religion, traditional medicine, etc. Taoist immortals spouting what sounds like gibberish to laypeople is a classic character trope. The evil creatures that Shang-Chi fights against do not fit into the xiaxia genre world view. If they are demons no explanation is given for why they are so demonic? Have they been denounced by a bohisattva? Are they former immortals who failed to cultivate and somehow reincarnated into the hungry ghost realm? It may just be that wuxia and xianxia are so deeply developed (and this is obvious when you watch any popular Chinese historical drama--from ""Eternal Love"" ot ""Legend of Fuyao"") that deivating from these highly developed genres makes the film feel less ""Chinese"". While many elements of Shang-Chi resemble a Chinese fantasy drama the lack of proper wuxia and xianxia elements makes it feel like philosophically something is missing--at least from someone who watches a lot of these dramas on Rakuten Viki!",negative
291,"Not only does Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings expand the MCU further and introduce new concepts for the future, but it delivers some badass choreographed action scenes and an emotionally complex villain.",negative
292,"Production: Good script even though certain scenes were predictable. Solid editing, but yet again too much slow motion to try to make action scenes look good. Decent CGI, it can be a little too much at times. Good set pieces and wardrobe. 7/10.On screen: Simu Liu (Shang-Chi) and Awkwafina (Katy) acting was great. They have good chemistry throughout the movie which made their characters believable. Decent acting from the rest of the cast, some of it was cookie-cutter. Solid Cinematography overall. 7/10.Content/Impact: It's great to see Asian leads in American cinema that's not stereotypical, especially at a time when we see anti-Asian hate during COVID. Also, the range of imagery of powerful Asian women is great to see because it combats the ""docile"" Asian women motif. Also, the fact that the Asian woman wasn't sexualized helps combat those stereotypes. Lastly, the infusion of Asian culture in popular films is not only good for getting more diverse filmmaking on and behind the camera, it's also a step in having more diverse visibility which leads to more acceptance of each other. 10/10.Overall: Good introduction to new characters Shang-Chi and Ruiwen's place in the new phase of the MCU. 8/10.",positive

296,"This is the first Marvel film since 2012's The Avengers that I would call a big dud. The reasons for its failure are many; the reasons that it almost succeeds are exactly two: Nora Lum (Awkwafina) and Ben Kingsley. Aside from these two shining points of light, the film's an energetic flop.The main reason for the failure is the script. Now, I have been watching movies for five decades, and I can tell when a film is paying homage to another film, and when it's just ripping off the ideas of a better movie. This 'script' rips off a series of better movies, starting with Deadpool 2, then Fight Club, then Skyfall, then Avatar, and probably a bunch of other action films I never saw. Along the way, we are asked to accept a silly premise that these magic rings and the bad guy wearing them have existed for a thousand years. Nope. Just a dumb idea. One look at his gleaming and perfect thousand year old teeth and the whole thing falls apart. The film never recovers from that.Next, there is the spectacularly bad directorial choice (from the aptly named Destin Cretton) to have all the actors in the film display no emotions with their faces whatsoever. As mentioned above, the sole exceptions are Awkwafina and Kingsley. Every other actor, AND ESPEICALLY PRETTY-BOY LEAD SIMU LIU, seems to be a star graduate from the Kristin Stewart school of blank stares. Boo. Maybe Cretton was going for Inscrutable, but all we see is Constipated.The fight scenes are all generic karate video game stuff, boring at first glance, but unbearably dull after two hours. The music by Joel West is one blaring trumpet after another, so forgettable that I can't remember anything except constant boring noise.The production design is wonderful, as we expect from Marvel: sets dripping in vivid color, crisp and exciting visuals, wonderful costumes. There are many beautiful and talented Asian actors on display here, but the script is so awful that I felt embarrassed for them. As I said, Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley save this film from being a complete flop, and their two performances are so wonderful that I am almost willing to let the rest of the garbage slide.Almost.",negative
297,"Finally!This movie was perfect,Nods to the Avengers in all the right places. Music is excellent. Casting is incredible. Visually stunning. Absolutely perfect. Would watch again right now. Haven't felt this good about a film in a very long time. Hoping to see more of Shang Chi in future MCU films.",positive
298,"Unfortunately, I didn't find this origin story to be as good as other reviews. It was too fast in building the characters for an origin story. They could have just focused more on the dad and his early days and his overwhelming love or first love in a 1,000 years. Bring more heart into this story and the family. The father was almost a antagonist you wanted to feel some heart for, but they didn't show enough love. Hopefully, he becomes a great character in phase 4.",negative
299,"Couple of things, 1. The actors are made of plastic, I know it wasn't a CGI cartoon but the actors were so one dimensional it may as well have been. Have never seen live actors display the uncanny valley. 2. Feels alot more like a Disney film and less like a Marvel super hero movie. 3. It was super formulaic, Awkwafina was as usually not funny and every little chuckle was super forced. Overall had some good fight choreography but you can get that in any other Kung Fu Movie. Kind of makes you wonder why so much money was spent on a very very very template movie. Kind of lame.",negative
300,"I have no Idea of why they were really fighting, it felt arbitrary like they just made up something randomly that didn't really make sense. It felt more like a 80ies story then an modern MCU story.This is not a superhero movie, and maybe that's why they lost me, because I was expecting a superhero film. Not a B movie type story with better special effects. This might be the last MCU movie I will ever see, it is that bad... I might make an exception for Captain Marvel II... :)",negative
301,"Marvel, you sneaky SOBs, is there nothing - I mean NOTHING at all - that you can't
turn your hands to? I'll be the first to admit that I was very sceptical about what really amounts to a glorified Kung Fu movie finding its place in the MCU. I need not have worried. Shang Chi sits right up there with the very best Marvel has on show.Simu Liu and the ever wonderful Akwafina make a fantastic duo and the addition of the queenly Michelle Yeo and the wonderful Tony Leung is the icing on the cake. It's exciting, adventurous fun. So go see it, you definitely won't regret it!",negative
302,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a wonderful movie in so numerous ways... Visually striking, with a great mastery of the staging from beginning to end.So much visual poetry, the legend/adventure aspect of it is really top-notch, with legends & mystical elements that grab you ever more with the story unveiling before your eyes ... The humor is very pleasant (Katy, played by Awkwafina, brought a welcome energy & heart in each of her scenes) and adds a pretty pleasant flavor to the whole adventure.I really loved the way the characters are written, with Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) as a complex & layered figure all along the movie... And Xialing (Shang-Chi's sister, played by Meng'er Zhang), as well as Li (their mother) are both highly enjoyable to see express themselves on-screen, they both have a lot of presence (and skills), each in their own ways.I found the entire movie very coherent, every detail makes sense and is counter balanced in a way or another... Yes, there is a strong notion of balance (darkness & light, and so on), with a lot of messages infused in both the action & dialogs. It is an extremely entertaining movie, but I really wanted to emphasize the richness and depth of its story/mythology and characters, all connected in the most organic way.By the way, I loved the whole Asian/Chinesz myths & legends aspec of the movie, the spirit & philosophy of it all was a true delight to my eyes, with countless Sci-Fi elements entwined in it, but all smoothly integrant of this mythology...
I think I probably put it in my Top 5 Marvel movies... I found the staging really majestic, from the dialog scenes to the action scenes, the humor, the flashbacks, and this new ""universe"" (mythology) that is presented here, it just all flows in such a delightful way from beginning to end.Marvel Studios always are very very clever at hiring a great variety of talents, and they nailed it once again... Destin Daniel Cretton (the director of the movie) is super creative and manages to construct pretty complex scenes while always masterfully telling a story, building a deeply cohesive piece ; it's all fantasy but nonetheless feels visceral and real. This movie is another Marvel movie you often forget that it is a Marvel movie, precisely because of its powerful and so deeply captivating mythology, and this emotional weight that you can feel over the characters, it truly sets something different. It felt like I was watching a movie in the vein of certain epic Asian adventure/martial arts movies... Gotta admit it's my jam, so... In addition to the Marvel stuff, it's a very pleasant feeling.The energy in the movie theater was fun, lots of people were excited from all these scenes that just grab you. Because yes, clearly... There is a good number of mind-blowing scenes in this incredible movie ! The photography and color treatment make the movie very striking... And like I said, certain scenes mesmerize you because of their beauty & mastery, or even their grand epicness ! At times, it feels like an epic fresco that you are contemplating.The scene when/where the two parents meet for the first time is beyond gorgeous (the setting, the colors, the choreography, the costume design and overall design, the music & sound effects, the characters and the atmosphere as a whole) ; an absolute masterpiece of art, visually way beyond sublime, what a gift for the eyes, wow... And the 'Grand Final' is quite simply epic, emotionally grabbing, and of course stunning visually, with a flow of glorious shots that all are impressive.A jewel.",positive
303,"I have to agree with another reviewer here...it's probably the least Marvel of all the Marvel movies. Had it been edited to a certain effect, one would not be able to discern it as a Marvel film.It's a background story of Shang-Chi obviously, but in a way, I felt like Tony Leung stole a bit of the show. It's his anguish that drives the film, as without it, there wouldn't be a conflict between him and Shang. Seeing Tony onscreen after so many years makes me want to go on a Tony Leung marathon, or at least watch Hard-Boiled again. He's always been so good at conveying emotion without words.Michelle Yeoh has small part in the film, but as always, she kicks ass and more or less plays the same exact role she played in the recent Gunpowder Milkshake as the older, wise Auntie.Simu Liu and Awkwafina have good chemistry in the film, but I actually felt like their characters otherwise were a little bit flat, as there was not much time spent on character development. Or at least in the character of Shang, alot of time devoted to flashbacks but little time spent with Simu in the present day, fleshing out his character. They seem like they would be fun people to hang out with? Awkwafina is vital to a plot moment, but otherwise, she has little presence other than a few small comedic moments but maybe that is enough.Morris is cute. I need to find that stuffed animal...The special effects are fun to watch and colorful.The plot is a bit simplistic, as it usually is with Marvel films. It's serviceable enough, but the film starts to fall apart during last 1/3-1/4 of the film when the fantastical elements show up and certain things happen that don't quite make any sense (or at least I haven't worked out why they should make sense). The fantasy elements don't quite work as well as just watching all the fight choreography from the earlier parts of the film, it's just not as interesting to me personally.All in all, a good time and a great prelude to a Labor Day weekend!",negative
304,I thought this movie was long. 2 hrs 12 min. Felt more like 2.5-3 hrs. I was ok at first but as it went on I got bored and couldn't believe it felt so long. There were other people laughing and enjoying his side-kick comedy. It was all too 13 yr. Oldish for me. Not a bad movie but NOT a 8.1 tho. 5-6. AVERAGE.,negative
305,"Let's face it, Shang-chi is pretty much Black Panther with an all Asian cast. I'm sure this sounds rather cynical but here me out: the first half of the film is a down-to-earth James Bond kind of film, then our protagonist reunited with his family halfway through and is transported to a fantasy world, only to have internal family conflicts drive the rest of the plot. Sound familiar? I'm in no way saying the two are parallels but this overarching story arc is becoming cliche. Black Widow was sort of guilty of this in a way, but was still unique in its own right, for better or for worse. In the case of Shang-Chi, the plot was extremely predictable. He would inevitably reunite with his family and battle his father. That didn't strip the film of all suspense, but Marvel screenwriting remains an Achilles heal.Wew! Now that I've got that out of the way, here's everything I loved about this movie: this has the GREATEST fight choreography of any Marvel movie Ever. There was this beautiful, majestic rhythm and flow to every single action scene that at many parts gave me literal goosebumps. For once, the CGI complimented the action beautifully without making me cringe. In a way it was like a remake of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. In addition, the acting was above average for a Marvel movie. The complex motivations of the hero and villain were realistically portrayed. Speaking of the villain, Xu Wenwu deserves a spot next to Thanos and Killmonger as one of Marvel's greatest antagonists. And compare to the snooze-fest that was Black Widow, the plot was flying as fast as a dragon. Finally, the cherry on top, Awkwafina and the hilarious comic-relief she infused into this whole story. Her style was really reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy. The film wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining without her.Overall, this definitely exceeded expectations (although they were pretty low after Black Widow). It's a pleasing popcorn movie with enough complexity and artistry to garner some awards. And for Marvel fans, it's clear Shang-Chi's existence in this universe is a game changer.",negative
306,"Overall, the movie was worth a watch. A lot of pretty scenery and great fight scenes. It is just getting ridiculous how the directors and production companies are not caring about the movie quality anymore, as long as they get their messages out. You can tell the director and writer have never picked up a Marvel Comic. They way they try to make you see that this movie is tied into the Marvel Universe is ludicrous. I see the writers all sitting around someone who got themselves in the group because daddy works at a higher level. No experience whatsoever.""Let's see, I have an idea. Ok hear me out. Wong, Wong is Asian so lets make sure he makes an appearance. That makes great sense to me. Now what reason would Wong have to fight in a place you wouldn't find anyone as honorable as he is, to be hanging out. Ok, let's don't explain that people will just get it because he is Asian, right? Ok now who would he fight in the ""Look here I am to connect this movie to us"" scene? Oh, I got it. Abomination. Ya that makes total sense to me. I mean, Wong was just minding his business one day, and Abomination stopped by because he was in the area and wanted to know if he wanted to go fishing. Wong said sure, let me open up a portal to the lake and we will go. Oh, my. My portal got messed up. How did we get to an illegal fight club in China? Ok, I guess while we are here, we will sign up to fight each other, since I just forgot how to open my portals. (Oh No!) Fight, Fight, Fight. Ok Abomination I am going to make you punch yourself. Hands through the portal, my favorite trick. Works all of the time. Ouch, Wong. That hurt. Oh but guess what Abomination. When you took that hit, it woke me up to remember how to open my portals again. Let's go home, shall we. Ok Wong, let's go.That is it. It would rival the greats. I am a genius.No you are an idiot. Actually, you may just have bad taste. The hiring people at Marvel are idiots and the people that give final approval, are no better.Well, we had a good first round of Marvel movies for 20 years. The millennium generation is taking over, so it is all downhill from here. Dang.",negative
307,"I was blown away by the great storyline from start to finish, amazing choreography, stunning visuals, and surreal locales. It's happy, it's sad, it's funny, it's touching. It knows when to be serious and knows when to be hilarious. The blend between the classic Asian traditions and the modern world was a definite bonus. Plus, it focuses on a blend between mythical and natural. Besides that, it ties into the MCU seamlessly. The movie thankfully explains a connection between the faux Ten Rings in the Iron Man movies and the actual Ten Rings. I also enjoyed all of the Easter eggs. This movie was worth the wait.",positive
308,Disney Marvel has a perfect way of simplifying the comic books into something a non-comic book reader can understand and follow along with. In my opinion this is the perfect movie to watch and see the excellence of telling a story without overwhelming the audience with comic book lore.

309,"I didn't know what to expect going in, superhero? Martial arts? And to me it ended up being more fantasy/supernatural than superhero. That being said, I liked it and I was entertained, it had a strange 80's vibe to me and I had feelings at times like I have seen this before...probably just me. The story was good, acting was good, visuals were spectacular, the middle did kinda drag a little, but overall it was a good movie.If you're looking for a martial arts movie, it's not Enter the Dragon and it's certainly not superhero like Spider-man or Superman. It's different, fresh, and I can see why many will love it. You could hate superheroes in general and still love this movie, so it would be a shame for people to avoid this movie because they don't like Superhero movies. I say give it a shot, but don't expect anything like Enter the Dragon or Superman, you will be disappointed.",negative
310,"Didn't have high hope before going in because neither Simu nor Awkwafina was a superhero movie casting material, and Mandarin is a very controversial villain of choice, but I was pleasantly surprised on how good Shang-Chi was.The chemistry between Simu and Awkwafina was exceptional, and Tony Leung's casting of Not-Mandarin aka Xu Wenwu was not just amazing, but one of the best villains Marvel has ever seen. It's a villain whose motivation is actually both believable and relatable. Oh, and the actual ""Mandarin"" was also a comical gold.Plus, fighting scenes were absolutely amazing. First half's martial art scenes were on par with some martial arts classics and later half of, well, typical Marvel CGI stuff were quite of eye candies.Sure, there were few less developed character arcs like Shang-Chi's sister but overall, this is an excellent movie that won't disappoint you.",negative

314,"Shang Chi is a completely action-packed movie, from start to end. Sure, the story was predictable with a meek narrative, but those gaps were filled with 2 hours of crazy action. The action sequences and cinematography in itself were quite impressive, considering a good portion of the movie showed sequences without any super powers. Its a good watch!",positive
315,"Black Widow kicked off Phase 4 with relatively muted excitement. Blame BW's performance on the pandemic, pirating, whatever. But for a movie that's several years overdue and months delayed, it was an underwhelming opening to the next step of the MCU both in story quality and action directing.Shang-Chi does a lot of heavy lifting and bounces Phase 4 back to Marvel's in-form output with one of the strongest Origin-Story films yet. A combination of a great cast and actor chemistry, palatable plot and storytelling, and the vibrant beauty of Chinese & Chinese-American culture interwoven naturally into the interactions between characters makes Shang-Chi an incredibly fun film for anyone not up-to-date on the MCU and an instant favorite for any die-hard MCU fans. And yet, even with each strong component that this film brings to the table, the most noteworthy highlight is that Shang-Chi has managed to seamlessly adapt Kung Fu choreography into the BEST hand-to-hand fight choreography that the MCU has ever seen. (Yes, in my opinion, it's better than the fight choreo from CA:Winter Soldier; that's no small feat). The action sequences here, backed by a well-fitting and punchy soundtrack make the action of Shang-Chi almost as exciting as that of the best Avengers movies.Not a perfect film by any means, some of the story elements are not fully developed and we also have the scheduled 3rd act CGI battle that seems to come with every MCU movie. Even so, the highs certainly outweigh the lows and in all, highly recommend seeing this movie. My thoughts are too cluttered by the awe inspired by the movie so a quick recap of the pros:Great action (no seriously, really great action. This is the John Wick of superhero films)Stunning visualsGreat soundtrackGreat cast, very fun interactionsTony Leung is incredible in this movie; the antagonist of this film is a Top 3 MCU ""villain""Simu Liu seems like a really great guy.

319,""" If you aim at nothing, you get nothing ""Shang chi gets most of the part right with crazy action choreography which is undoubtedly the major attraction. First act is racy and has crazy action episodes and later, the recurring flashbacks served the story purpose but at the same time, slightly hindered the flow. Not a big issue though as the action part kicks in and makes up for it. Third act ten rings action visuals are pretty damn good and the water formation is breathtaking which reminded me of Raya.New guy "" Simu Liu "" owned the Shang chi role, as his efforts are clearly visible on the screen. Especially during action episodes , he nailed it with his quick reflexes, even Meng'er Zhang as Chi's sister did put up an impressive act and Awkwafina provided a bit of humor with her quirky attitude . Fala Chen is so beautiful, i fell head over heels for her smile. The man, Tony Leung stood tall and delivered with panache, his presence worked big time. Always love to see Michelle Yeoh on the screen , she got that aura which pulls me in. Trevor and Morris stole the show, loved their bonding :)Over all , with couple of surprises , good performances , amazing score , striking visuals and top notch action pieces makes this one an enjoyable ride throughout. Had a good time at the cinemas. Simu Liu is a fine addition to the MCU. Easily deserves solid 7-7.5 rating !!First post credit scene is whistle worthy moment , JUST WOW!!!",positive
320,"In the future we need more fantasy open world series in MARVEL its kinda trending for along time , fans and peoples waiting for something like this , its hype above all movies...
So the myth has been adapted in movies ,mystical beings fought face to face , it's been a long time to watch movie like , we did watch chinese fantasy series with low budget dragons & mystical beings , but not like this , we could see proper visual effect arts of the fight , I wish marvel studios could do more beast fighting in fantasy realm with HEREOS and VILLAINS, or LIMBO like Devil may cry kind of... yeah it does looks like DANTE running above dragon back fighthing his Devil father.. end up his father saved him and let him inherit the fortunes power of the families.. anyway im still waiting DEVIL may cry movie live action , i dont know when the hollywood going to adapt the movie someday.. i hope the dream come true for all of us.. If you want more profit just do movie like this , peoples like it very much.. fantasy all.. humans dreams to be like that , but it will happen only in afterlife... i mean for real , you should check your religion books about afterlife..",negative
321,"I was kind of bored through out and this is coming from a pretty big MCU shill. I think the funny side-kick made the movie worse honestly. I didn't really care about her or her random, forced character arc in the last part of the movie. The fight scenes were fun, but if you saw the trailer, you saw the funnest fights. There's a dragon too, but I was just waiting for the movie to be over at that point.",negative
322,"I had least expectations about this movie. I thought probably it would have some fight sequences which depicts a typical chinese movie. But it is more than that. I had an awesome theatre experience after endgame. Seriously guys, don't miss this one.",negative
323,"I was actually borderline giving this a 7 out of 10 but can't quite bring myself to do it because the middle is so booooooring!I did however, on the whole really enjoy this but I did think that it was more about the whole cast rather than an origin story of Shang-Chi because an awful lot of attention seems to be given his sister and his friend Katy which seemed odd to me?But sort of odd in a good way because they managed to flesh the characters out enough to make them seem like 'characters' rather than expendable supporting cast.The first third of the movie was for me, the strongest and seeing the full fight scene on the bus shown in the trailer made me appreciate the choreography that went into this. The final third was fine... I wasn't bored... The middle though? Nah :(I preferred this to Black Widow because it's part of the new phase and not some remnant carry over and just felt fresh!There's also some fairly ok humour in there (a lot which misses the mark too though)... yeah, it was good, you should go see it if you like the MCU.",negative
324,"A movie with clear and crisp visuals that blends Chinese Kung Fu with CGI to perfection, but this seems to come at a cost of a weak and underdeveloped plot with misplaced priorities that prevents the audience from investing into the characters.",positive
325,"Very good movie. Perfect casting,great visuals,Good story and direction makes it enjoyable.the screenplay was a little bit predictable like formulatic marvel movie. I totally recommend to see this one in theaters because it was made to have that kind of experience.",positive
326,"Absolutely loved it. IMO, it's the best MCU movie and that's saying a LOT, coming from me. It's original, has a great story, good screenplay, excellent fight scenes WITH the actors (not stuntmen), the villain has a unique agenda (not just to kill the hero or take over the world), the origin story is told perfectly, the superpower (the rings) is really interesting, and the music is fantastic. It finally bumped Iron Man down to #2 on my MCU list.",positive
327,"This movie really surprised me I loved the action scenes specially the one that takes place in a bus, I wish they kept that ""grounded"" action line but at the end they go with big cgi fights, which are good but I just really loved those hand to hand action scenes.Also I find the villian irrelevant, he isn't too bad for you to hate him nor he isn't too good to be loved.",negative
328,"I'm a sucker for a good quality martial arts fight scene, and this has many of them. Every one is perfect. The movie has humor, heart, and really amazing fight scenes. I love the visual effects, the tradition and culture of the rich Chinese people, it overall just worked and I'm so excited to go see it for a second time.",positive
329,"How can anyone give such a movie a 5/10 or below??? Really?! It's stunningly beautiful in its very own way, the kung fu, the humor, the visuals, the atmosphere, everything, SO GOOD! I'm just gonna leave it to that! Please go watch it and please ignore the bad reviews. People are so stupid that they just don't know what a good movie is anymore smh.",negative
330,"One of my favorite Marvel movies to date. Loved the acting and FX. Its tough to blend martial arts fighting that looks good, no beautiful and magic. They did it. Great story and pacing. Highly recommended. Much, much better than Black Panther, Wonder Woman 1985 and Black Widow combined in my opinion.It's the type of super hero movie that as a kid would have inspired days of playing out the heroes with friends and many rewatches all summer long. Go see it and take your 12+ old kids, they will love it!",positive
331,"Entertaining from the get-go, alluring with an excellent build-up and great choreography that takes you back to the 'Crouching Tiger' era, Shang-Chi adds an interesting dynamic to the MCU.The two main leads are compelling, I loved the comedic timing of Awkwafina and the seamless choreography of the movie, everything flowed easily, and the color palette and cinematography are also compelling arguments here. My favorite scene is a harmonious ""dance"" between two characters that grabbed me to the screen and didn't let go.Overall, if you enjoy Chinese mythology mixed in with the familiarity of the MCU then you are sure to enjoy this origin story, the best one since 'Black Panther', for me at least. It got me hyped about what is coming!Be on the lookout for two after-credits scenes!",positive
332,"This movie is a blast and then some. It is, just like Black Panther was, a Marvel movie and it's own thing at the same time. It brings a much needed freshness to MCU. The story is about Shang-Chi, a Kung Fu fighter, who is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. Is this the same Ten Rings organization from Iron Man and Iron Man 3? I'll let the movie explain.Director Destin Daniel Cretton successfully blends in his culture in the Marvel format, but also keeps it real, authentic and most importantly communicates a very personal story effectively. At the heart of it, this is a movie about a dysfunctional family dealing with their family drama. I'm not going to talk about what the drama is as that will be a spoiler. But with that drama comes some of the best Kung-Fu fights I've seen on the big screen in a long time.Simu Liu as Shang-Chi and Awkwafina as his best friend are well known stars, but after this movie they will be upgraded to superstar status. They were brilliant in the movie and were yin to each other's yang. Where Simu Liu brought the punches, Awkwafina brought. The punchlines. They complimented each other to create the perfect balance. Another character that left an impression on me is Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as Shang-Chi's father. The love-hate relationship between him and Shang-Chi is relatable and just so heartbreaking.Rest of the star cast is also brilliantly casted and this movie has some of the best written supporting characters. The core group consists of Fala Chen as Shang-Chi's mother who is the soul of this movie, Meng'er Zhang as his sister who is just as much of a kick ass as Shang-Chi and Michelle Yeoh as his aunt who becomes his guide and teacher. There is also a surprise character in the movie that I loved, but I am not going to talk about it and spoil it for you guys.This is a Marvel product so you know that the VFX & CGI are industry best. Adding to that are the beautiful Cinematography and the fast paced Camera Work. Each and every fight sequence is meticulously handled and spectacularly choreographed. You have seen some of the bus fight scenes in the trailer, but there are other high stake fight scenes that will also leave you breathless.You knew you were going to watch this movie when it came out. My review is just to tell you that yes, it is everything you expected and wanted it to be. I personally never doubted Kevin Feige. Now go watch this movie and let it knock your socks off.P. S. - This movie has a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene, so make sure you catch those.",positive
333,"Shang-Chi has instantly entered my top 5 of Marvel movies. There is so much to adore about this movie. The visuals are beautiful, the villain is compelling, the last sequence isn't very predictable, as superhero movies can often be. The characters all have a level of depth that is often missing from the supporting characters in superhero movies, and I was pleased that they didn't marginalize Xialing as it would've been easy to do. I don't know much about the different disciplines of martial arts, but it seems very similar to Avatar: The Last Airbender in how they drew inspiration from different real world fighting styles for different fighters in the movie. If I compare the acting to the other movies I consider the best to produced by Marvel (Infinity War, Ragnarok, Winter Soldier, etc.), Shang-Chi is a notch below, but it blows every other Marvel movie out of the water when it comes to action and choreography. The bus scene in the first act has easily become my favorite sequence in any Marvel film. Origin films often fall into the same traps, but Shang-Chi doesn't, maybe because many didn't know much about the character. But even so, typical tropes like training sequences were done better in Shang-Chi, and the story didn't linger on his youth too much.",negative
334,"The movie is more like an action movie than a superhero one.The action are visual treat for audience but the storyline is not.However, considering the character introduction, it is still a good movie to watch.But certainly not the best MCU character introduction.Some animation scenes are really beautiful and the eastern mythology is always an inspiration.",neutral
335,"Marvel is becoming now Apple. No matter what you'll buy there products and have to say nicer even you can buy same kind of products somewhere else. Now this movie disappoints me so many places.First of all storytelling, I don't know when the story start and where it goes. Somehow I felt It takes unnecessarily emotional point. I can't say I am fully disappoint There are Lot of good action scenes. Very good acting, very good VFX. The only missing is nice story, this story not convinced me properly. I can only give 5 out of 10 ratings but because Of marble franchise and I believe Their future that's the reason I give 6 out of 10 ratings.",negative
336,"It was great to see one of the many MCU martial artist in live action and actually living up to their comic character (Iron Fist Netflix series blows btw). The fight scenes were fantastic along with the other action sequences. Most of the characters were easy to sympathize with and the cameos were great.The only thing I personally felt that didn't go over very well was Aquifina's performance and comedic lines. It felt a little flat and I thought Ben Kingsley was way more funny than her. If it wasn't for the fact she shot the evil soul sucker in the throat saving Shang Chi and his sister, you could have left her out or played her character without all of the comedic misses and it would have been fine.As mentioned however my son and liked the movie and it provided a nice lead in to the next big bad guy of the MCU (maybe Mephisto?). Definitely worth a watch in opinion.",negative
337,"Laugh, fights, drama, comedy, beautiful landscapes, dragons, martial arts , it's all wrapped up nice and smoothly!I had an amazing time watching it!Also the music was great!Worth watching it!",positive
338,Typical Marvel Movie- Lots of Action & Laughs. I saw this in IMAX and loved it! If you are a Marvel fan you will enjoy this movie. 2 extra credits so stay until the end.,positive
339,"What a breath of fresh air this film is, it's doesn't feel like your traditional Marvel film till the end scene, mid and end credit scene.Visually beautiful the creatures and scenery. The action was fast paced and blows you away.Can't fault this film, you walk out the cinema and could easily walk back in and watch it again.",negative
340,"Shang Chi movie Review
No spoilers
Oh wow! I really loved this film! It really went above and beyond my expectations. To tell you the truth I had no idea of how it would play out. As a matter of fact I am pretty good at predicting this but this movie really had me guessing. I highly recommend to watch this film. Of course it's a Disney Film so it gave vibes similar to Mulan and of course it's an Oriental film so it gave vibes of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. And of course it's a Marvel Comics film but this isn't your regular Marvel movie. I highly recommend you to watch it if you haven't already. You are going to love it. Trust me. This is worth every penny.",positive
341,"An incredible MCU film. It offers nothing too cerebral, but that is not the main focus of the film. The comedy, the action, the themes, the choreography and the vibrant visuals make this film a standout among similar standalone Marvel films, while the layered and truly epic soundtrack is the finishing touch. While some of the effects and the pacing perhaps could have been a little more polished, and the final battle had some weaknesses, this is a colourful, emotional and fun rollercoaster of a film. Tony Leung is by far the standout member of the cast, delivering a captivating and even sympathetic villain. Simu Liu holds his own, but needs more time to really shine as a new Marvel superhero-while Meng'er Zhang, Awkwafina and Fala Chen are integral to this film's effectiveness. Overall, this fun and touching movie is an exemplar of the 'Marvel formula' and its strengths.",positive
342,"Lovely plot, great characters, awesome designs & costumes. As a martial artist fan I loved the fight choreography & stunts. They felt fresh and authentic.The mix between Martial Arts, Action, Fantasy & Drama was great. I was worried about the movie, when I watched the trailer. The CGI effects were amazing. Just felt like it didn't needed it. The movie got its own marvel flavor, when the cgi scenes took over.I had a lot of fun during watching. Specially the fighting scenes, action scenes and with a lovely humor.The acting was fantastic. Shang-Chi's character development was great just overshadowed by his fathers character in my opinion, cause the story of his father was somehow more interesting. The chemistry between Shang-Chi & Katy was the icing on the cake. So lovely and perfectly matches into the movie.This is the first Hollywood movie for Tony Leung. He did an amazing job.I think it's safe to say they did well to represent Asian culture on a big movie screen. I highly recommend this to every marvel fan. They did an outstanding job.",positive

344,"When you thought the MCU pulled everything out of the closet. This movie has everything. Amazing special effects, good editing, deserved character development and an intriguing plot. This movie is a solid blockbuster and very aesthetically pleasing.The only bad thing about it was that at some point in the movie, it's enough. The ending felt like it was being dragged out.This is the best MCU origin story by FAR.",positive
345,"Disclaimer: I watched the Spanish dubbed version of this film. Therefore, I am unable to provide criticism of the original actors' acting in this film.Shang-Chi is a hit! One of my favorite Marvel films for sure. While it indeed takes place in the MCU, it just doesn't feel like other Marvel films, in a good way, that is. Our protagonist has no real superpowers, and the cheesy, outlandish fictional elements characteristic of many other Marvel films have been exchanged for more mystical, creative elements. As another reviewer has put it, it's almost as if this film belonged more to the Harry Potter universe than the MCU.The story revolves around Shaun (Simu Liu) and his friend Katy (Awkwafina), two young valet drivers living in San Francisco. After a rather exhilarating episode on the bus to work where a group of men steal Shaun's jade pendant, he decides to visit his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) in China to warn her that they'll be going after her next. Katy insists on joining, and during the plane ride, Shaun reveals to her his true identity and back story: he is Shang-Chi, a great martial arts warrior from China whose father Xu Wenwu (brilliantly cast by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) possesses the titular legendary rings (which are actually more like bracelets, if you ask me), which give him god-like power and immortality. They wrap around his forearms and glow bright blue, and seem to have some mystical magnetic properties. Ever since Shang-Chi and his sister's mother Li (Fala Chen) died when they were children, their father has not been right in the head and has developed an obsession for the bracelets. One day he starts hearing what he believes to be his wife's voice call out to him, and thus sets out to reunite with her in the secret city of Ta Lo, her hometown which is very hard to get to. Our heroes must stop him before he opens up Pandora's box.The visuals in this film are spectacular, especially the creative uses of bright, contrasting colors. What's really neat about this film is how the first half portrays modern Chinese culture and the second half portrays a more traditional Chinese culture. You get the best of both worlds, if you will. I am no expert on Chinese culture, by any means, but this film was made in a way that I believe respects it. The film also makes use of Mandarin language from time to time (particularly during flashbacks), which gives it more a sense of authenticity than having all the Chinese characters speak English all the time.I do have a slight criticism. In Avengers Endgame, there was an extremely cheesy and cringeworthy scene near the end where all the female characters were shown side by side, all the Black characters were shown side by side, etc. The rather random appearance of the character Wong in this movie is more or less an extension of that scene. It's as if Kevin Feige (or perhaps director Destin Daniel Cretton) said, ""Oh. We have this new Shang-Chi movie featuring a mostly Asian cast. Let's throw Wong from Dr. Strange in there because he's Asian."" It's more realistic to show characters of different races working together, and it sends a better message as well. In the same way Black Panther features a mostly Black cast, it's as if Marvel wants to make up for its previous exclusion of Asian characters by cramming as many as they can into this one movie. We will see what the future has in store for Shang-Chi and characters of color in the MCU.Overall, I really can't complain too much about this film. Some of the special effects (in particular the ""blast"" sound effects attributed to the rings) are over the top, but the CGI in general is stellar, and the setting and costumes are fun and fresh. The fight scenes in particular are great. The presence of the character Katy is a bit cliché to the superhero genre; she felt a lot like the equivalent of Peter Parker's friend Ned in the Tom Holland Spiderman movies. That is, she really only serves the purpose of being the protagonist's best friend and because of that is capable of doing things she otherwise wouldn't be capable of doing, for the sake of the plot. It would have been cool if Shang-Chi instead had a sensei-like teacher to guide him (as is the case with Liam Nesson's Raz al Ghul in Batman Begins), but I guess that role is played by his dad during flashback scenes. After all, this isn't really an origin story. I also would have liked to see them do more with Shang-Chi's sister, because she doesn't get nearly as much screen time and character development as he does. Some of the humor fell flat, but, as I said in the disclaimer, I watched the Spanish dubbed version, so maybe it's actually funnier in the original English. In conclusion, Shang-Chi exceeded my expectations, and I will likely be watching it again in the near future.",negative
346,"I really liked the movie. The fight scenes were great and CGI was excellent. My only confusion was why some characters were so shocked that there were mystical creatures and the story that Shawn and Katie was telling their friends was so unbelievable to them especially since the timeline of this movie takes place after End Game. Did they not see aliens come down with crazy abilities? I think once this happens, someone has to believe that anything is possible.",negative
347,"There's no way people here this movie. It's not near perfect and not the best marvel movie but c'mon, this was epic and the plot was not bad at all. Definitely had epic fight scenes, settings and moment.",negative
348,Loving the classic spirit being brought back. Also kudos for bringing the Kungfu Hustle icon on board this mega Fu-fest. This deserves a rewatch for many years since Joy Luck Club. This piece is made by heart surely.,positive
349,Clever story with amazing martial arts and interesting backdrops. I enjoyed and appreciated the English Subtitles that were clear to read and on onscreen longer the most movie subtitles. The martial arts was exhilarating! Loved it! The CGI was colorful and creative. This film should win multiple Oscar Awards!!This movie was so entertaining I must see it again!!,positive
350,"'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is absolutely on my list of favorite Marvel movies. 2021 has been full of hyped up films that have ultimately left me disappointed, but this one lives up to every bit of its hype.The action from beginning to end was some of the best I've seen in a Marvel movie or in general in a very long time. The choreography, especially when performed by Michelle Yeoh, Meng'er Zhang, and Fala Chen (and stunt doubles) felt like poetry in motion. Everything was done with so much grace and elegance that I did not want it to end. Simu Liu brought both charisma and charm as Shang-Chi while delivering some amazing action sequences too. He was nothing short of fitting for the role. And to my surprise ""Awkwafina"" was not as unbearable as I assumed she would be.The movie does lose some momentum in the 3rd act as it slows down a bit and takes a deeper dive into the story, but quickly picks back up as you head into the final battle. The set and CGI used creates some breathtaking shots that adds to the greatness of the film.Marvel fan or not this film is worth going to see.",negative
351,"One of the best Marvel movies I've ever seen, was not expecting for it to be this good but it exceeded expectations far and beyond. Definitely recommend this!",negative
352,"Haven't been much of a Marvel guy even with their biggest event films, but Shang Chi is solid. Story moves quick, lots of great characters, almost nonstop action scenes, and a finale that they hid from the trailers. I was definitely way more into it than I thought I'd be. Props to the team on this one!",negative
353,"I was very impressed with the narrative of this film. Not predictable at all. Amazing fight choreography. Sometimes the action sequences were blurry, which was my only complaint. Great cast. Color grade was pretty good too.",negative

356,"This is one of my favourite Marvel origin films.The storyline, visuals, the cast, fight and stunt scenes were amazing. In fact I'd say it was beautiful and respectfully made.Simu is perfect as Shang-Chi, sorry I doubted his casting as kept thinking of Jung from Kim's Convenience (good show).",positive
357,"I'm not gonna lie. The movie didn't impress me much based on the trailer. I still wanted to see it because, well, Marvel movies are just fine and I believed it would be good. And it was. It was. The story, in my opinion, wasn't as good as it usually is with Marvel. Not that Marvel has any masterful storylines, but it just wasn't as good in my opinion as some of the other movies that have come out from the studio in the past. What was more than good, on the other hand, was the music in places. But what was without a doubt the best and what Marvel has always been able to do and probably always will be able to do is action. The action scenes here are awesome, although then they are not very frequent. There are a few times when the pace slows down and we wait for some of the fights. Once it does though, you're in for an epic CGI load of fighting that I devoured. There's still the occasional quirk thrown in here and there, as is usually the case with Marvel movies. To sum it up. For me, a good movie that I recommend, and classically to Marvel fans.",negative
358,Something I feels new to this movie like it's beautiful and it's VFX is not quite as other Marvel Cinematic Universe Films VFX's. This film actors did a great job especially the hero. He was dope in this movie. And mainly the stunts it felt quite realestic. I became to watch it lately. Awesome.,positive
359,"What a fun ride with some emotionally touching scenes. Tony Leung Chiu-wai worked hard at making his character a different kind of villain who is not stereotypical and the way he loses connection and wallows in grief is deep. You can see what is causing him to act as he does.Simu Liu carries this movie alongside Tony Leung and it's got a lot of father/son conflict which is touching to see on screen.The fight scenes are really good, the action is top notch and I liked the friendship running along in the story. Stay for the two end scenes which tease so much!",positive
360,"For all intents and purposes this movie was your typical DC movie. And, for a MARVEL film that's every bit the insult it is intended to be. The over-the-top praise this effort has generated is either born from pure loyal slappies or people wishing to seem culturally progressive praising a ridiculously shallow cotton candy movie.Every character is superficial and the lead has the charisma of wet bread. The story itself is basic and never gives the viewer a chance to connect with ANY character or even their motivations. The tone jumps everywhere as if the director was handed a jigsaw puzzle worth of scenes and asked to string them together to frame CGI madness. Honestly from the completely silly over-the-top opening bus brawl through the insane CGI third act dragon fight, I don't remember ever rolling my eyes so much at a Marvel Studios endeavor. Well, maybe the third act of Black Widow but that just makes me realize how far Phase Four has wandered away from what made the MCU great. There are some visually stunning scenes and an overall good idea at play but everything falls in to some sort of kiddy cartoon category where nothing has any consequence either physically or emotionally.",negative
361,"The movie was entertaining to some degree and followed the standard Marvel Universe formula. Trite, current day pop cultural references and jokes during the first half of the movie were cheap and certainly will be lost on audiences of the future. A few idiots in the theatre guffawed loudly at most of them. As usual, though, the women were strong, kind and intelligent and the men were dumb and evil. Are we to believe that the most evil man in the Universe, Xi, is going to change his evil ways and that his wife would have even married a mass murderer on the scale of Genghis Kahn or Vlad the Impaler? Of course she's killed by his enemies and he returns to a life of evil and sends his henchmen to kill his own children to retrieve some necklaces so he can read a map. I will say Xi was a badass, as were Shang's sister, Aunt, and pretty much every other character compared to Shang, who was soft and definitely not superhero material. Awkwafina was funny and entertaining as usual, overshadowing Shang in most scenes as his character was so forgettably boring. Even his Aunt could kick his butt. Loved Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin, extremely funny and his performance was genius. The outcome was the usual for Marvel Universe and even the pre-view for the next movie during the credits was lame; I guess they could only get Mark Ruffalo and Brie Larson, perhaps the only two Marvel Universe characters lamer than Shang, to set up the next movie.",positive
362,Talented brilliant incredible amazing show stopping spectacular.,positive
363,"Every time I hear the Marvel opening in theaters, I get chills and I am SO HAPPY that I saw this film in theaters. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, kicks off a new wave of the MCU and I am so excited for the journey that lies ahead. Great characters, narrative, score, and action overall. Totally worth the watch! (Make sure to stay for all the mid/after credit scenes!)",positive

365,"Great movie, and one of my favourite MCU movies (just behind Thor Ragnarok and Guardians of the Galaxy Volume one). Amazing cast, fresh story, and out of this world CGI! Highly suggest you see it in a theatre, for the full experience!The loss of the one star is because as an Asian martial arts movie, it doesn't entirely live up to the greats that have come before it (Crouching Tiger, Hero, etc). Saying it is close though, is praise enough!Very excited this group is part of the MCU, excited to see more!",positive
366,"Shang Chi movie review-
Some spoilers
Pros:
The story. I thought this movie would be boring just because it's a character that I am completely unfamiliar with but it actually was very interesting. Not just the plot but the origin and the backstory on peoples lives, I really loved the idea of it all. It incorporated a lot of cool Asian culture as well as some hip-hop American vibes and culture too. It was a very awesome combination.The characters you don't see in the trailer. One of the main characters is Shang-Chi's sister, the girl with the short hair and bangs (left in picture). She is by far the coolest character in this entire movie and I don't know WHY she is not on the front of more posters and more trailers! Katy played by Awkwafina isn't just the person in the movie that's the comedy, there are others too and although she is funny she actually has a lot more depth to her character and does have some serious moments, she's in the whole movie. I liked her more than I thought I would.The fight scenes and action. Shang Chi (Shaun) is extremely skilled in Kung Fu and actually has a fighting style similar to Batman. If he had a cape it would be awesome, but I know his character doesn't need it. There are very cool scenes that reminded me of scenes in Wakanda but in a mystical Asian land where there are dragons and other cool fictional creatures. The sets are beautiful!Some cameos and also the music. I won't spoil anything but there are some pretty cool cameos in this movie that definitely set up the world of the Marvel universe. Although the one cameo we'd all love to see we cannot. RIP Stan Lee. This film actually had some really cool music, the main character actually sings a song or two on the soundtrack as well as some really cool hip-hop music. I suggest to go check it out!Cons:Some plot holes. There were some moments were I got confused with some of the details of the plot. There were things that were not answered you have to figure out on your own. It's good to go to the movies with people so that you can talk about it afterwards and catch things. It is one of those movies where you may have to see it again to catch some things that you missed. I wish they made it a little bit more clear.The weird friendship between Katy and Shaun. In the movie you see that the two leads are BEST friends, they work together. But in the real world that is not very realistic. They kind of hint that there may be something that comes of it, some moments where I totally thought it was going to be romantic. I just wish they would either make it romantic or not, not somewhere in between. I'm sure there will be more movies where they may make them a couple eventually.The Mandarin. For those of you who don't know, that is the father of Shang Chi and Xialing (the real one not the drunk one on Iron Man 3). He is a very tough man, a villain. I don't like the aspect of making his father the villain even though that's the way I'm sure it is in the comic books. It just seems sad and not a good story that his dad sucks. I wish Marvel had some more Mufasas.All in all though it was great! Stay for all the credits there's two! It was better than I thought.8/10.",negative
367,"This movie is very good, the fighting at sick, action was on point. I will say the first half of the movie was better then the 2nd but overall it was a fun action movie, couple dumb parts but it's very enjoyable. Like a 7.6.",positive

371,"Stupid on every level. Fights are entertaining, but would rather watch any bad 70's chop socky movie over this poorly written, ludicrous story. Several of the characters are so unrelateable it makes me wonder if the writers, director or actors have ever met another person. Not worth the time to write this review except that somehow this is getting a 7.9 at this moment which cannot be real. IMDB should be embarrassed shilling for this mess.",negative
372,"Kind of boring film. The premise is interesting, but kind of comedic all over and with little compromise with being convincing. I mean, Marvel films have this requirement for suspension of disbelief by default, but this film kind of explains very little and the character's interaction is shallow and not very meaningful. The end is predictable, everything looks artificial.Perhaps we are all vaccinated against Marvel's all over the place magic to a point that everything looks familiar, boring and flat. Or perhaps the film is just not that great.My big problem with this film is the bus sequence at the start. It eeps going downhill. I mean.. if you can make turns with the bus, why does it keep going down all the time? Turn left twice, it will go uphill instead of downhill and decelerate, then turn to any side and it should come to a standstill. Not very clever, guys.",negative
373,"The stroy is amazing yes, tho feels like i saw it before. Nothing new here but the bus scene. I was rly exited to see marvel taking another direction but i was wrong.. If the movie had more moments like the bus scene it could have been an easy 10/10 for me but the potentioal was unfortunatly wasted.Then all that CGI crap with that dragon and those rings was aight but like show me crazy fight scenes like the bus scene i just dont understand why every marvel movie as to include cgi. In most cases its great but not in this one, they could have sticked with the fighting formula and it would have been great. Other then that some funny moment but thats all i gotta say on this one.",negative
374,"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad.",negative
375,"The way marvel fanboys(Marvel having one of the worst fan base, toxic and childish) praise this CGI crap is pure comedy! The story is trash and the jokes are as we all know already: cheesy, cringi and lame! But bcz it is a Marvel movie, of course it is praised! Doesn't matter of Marvel make a movie about a dog barking for two hours, the toxic fan base will still say about the movie: ""it's a masterpiece"" 2 stars for some entertaining action scenes! And the lady is ANNOYING aSF!!!!!! I really dare to say The Suicide Squad from that marvel clown: James Gunn is better than this full of CGI trash! My opinion! It was like watching a cartoon with stupid(almost all of them) fighting scenes just for the ...for the what? For the enjoyment of marvel incels!",positive
376,"There is some good acting in this movie, cinematography and visual effects. Certainly some well choreographed action and martial arts scenes. However, the story line is somewhat lacking. It also tries its hand at some comic moments but most don't cut the mustard, I'm managed a couple of small giggles along with my fellow cinema going compatriots.",positive
377,"I was pleasantly surprised by a few things:
1. The plot was simple and thus mostly free of unignorable holes.2. Integration of the Chinese elements were quite well done.3. Reasonable development of characters including the bad guy.4. (Mostly) very well orchestrated fight sequences. Quite enjoyable actually. Felt like Jackie Chan at times.5. The movie has a very good tempo. Action and story development do not feel out of the place.6. Not too many of the typical silly wisecracks. Still quite some but not as ridiculous as some movies.There're some stuff one can pick on like the girlfriend and sidekicks felt a bit out of place, some development was a bit too abrupt, plot too simple and typical etc. But none of these prevented the movie from being a quite enjoyable experience.",negative
378,I was excited for this movie anyways because I read the comics and I was even more hyped when I saw the reactions to the movie just before it was properly released. I watched it and yes it has it's moments it is good but not as amazing as people are saying. It currently stands at 8.1 on IMDb but it really should be mid 7s like 7.2 to 7.6 but not above. So keep in mind yes it's good but it has holes in the writing.,negative
379,"I really liked how the movie started and went in a certain direction for like the first hour but after that point, the movie suddenly becomes a lot more mystical and decides to sway from its direction which did more harm than good to the movie in my opinion. By the end, I just wanted to watch some cool looking, well choreographed hand-to-hand fight scenes but what I got was characters ""kamehameha""ing each other and gigantic beasts fighting along. But I guess I can't complain, I knew what I was going to get since this is a MCU movie after all.",negative
380,"I was never a fan of the Shang-Chi comic book, but this movie was very refreshing and amazing. Great introduction to Shang-Chi! Simu Liu is perfectly well casted. There was great chemistry between the leads, and the fight choreography is the best I've ever seen from Marvel. Great story line and action, and especially the comedy!!! Loved Awkwafina!! I can't give it 8 or 9 stars. I GIVE it a 10 star rating! Highly recommended! Watch it and you won't be disappointed.",negative
381,"Very well done. Great writing, directing, and acting. Beautiful choreography and cinematography. Loved the costumes.",positive
382,"I knew nothing about the comic book character and was curious how a martial arts character fits into the Avengers universe. The trailer didn't make me all that excited, but after seeing the movie I know why. SO MUCH is not shown in the previews, and it is all amazing content. There were a lot of surprises from characters to choreography, style to substance, and action to emotion. The film makes the complexity of family love its core, and that's what makes Shang-Chi such a riveting story. The villain is not a bad guy. His motive is love, not power. Despite what advantage the Ten Rings gives him, his current life is a transformed one for the better, until the indomitable enemy that is grief comes into his life.While, yes, this is an origin story, it doesn't feel like it in the typical MCU formula, which is very relieving. Shang-Chi doesn't go through training. He's already trained. His enemy isn't a pop-up for fighting's sake. It's his father who conjures conflict to fight against or try to love. Adding in the sibling complexity gives the movie more layers and more emotional stakes that are pretty raw throughout and huge in the third act. They wish their father would love them their way, not his, and try desperately to sober his longing to be rid of his grief. It makes all the balls-to-wall fantasy that's exponentially unleashed.And with this movie, Marvel tested its bravery wisely by leveraging the gorgeous art and culture of China. The fights choreographed more like dancing is so captivating. The rich, calm soundtrack that plays sensually throughout ramps you into the grand fantasy in the third act.Shang-Chi has no flaws that I can find. Acting, characters, story, soundtrack, script, and settings. None of it is weak. Shang-Chi is the best solo Marvel character film since Winter Soldier, and may surpass it.",negative
383,"This movie makes Black Widow look like an Oscar winning screenplay.The story is just SOOOO bad. There's way too much raw exposition about past events. It feels like half the movie is spent recounting the past in stale narrative exposition. When this much backstory is needed, then you're trying to pack too much into a single film.Character motivations are unclear. Shang Chi's behavior is inexplicable at times, and his sidekick's behavior is similarly confusing. The movie opens with the two of them in low paying jobs, yet somehow they are jet-set world travelers at the drop of a hat. Shang continually puts his friend in life-threatening danger.The movie is weakened by fan service. The callback to Iron Man 3 makes zero sense. Casting Ben Kingsley for comedic relief does nothing for the story.This movie all but breaks the MCU's continuity and overarching story. It introduces new dimensions, races and powers without regard for existing storylines.Cameos don't help. Kingsley's Trevor Slattery feels about 10 years too late and most of his previous story arc from ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Hail to the King"" is negated and/or ignored. Wong is used as comic relief, but doesn't help much more than that.There's nothing fresh in this movie, just Disney trying to cash in on an inferior product.",negative
384,"This movie was highly anticipated and it held up to my expectations. As a massive Marvel fan, this movie had me fully engaged from start to finish. The fight sequences were amazing! They were very different from most movies, making them very unique. Every actor gave a wonderful performance as well. I'm not rating this one a 10/10 because of the dragon sequence towards the end. It was awesome at the start, but it seemed to drag out a bit too long. Still very entertaining though. Even if you're not a Marvel fan, I still highly recommend seeing this film. You don't need much Marvel background when seeing this one. Obviously, if you're a Marvel fan, you will for sure piece things together. Overall, Shang-Chi is a stunning film.",negative
385,"This movie was fantastic! It did a great job of standing on its own while including little easter eggs from the rest of the MCU throughout the film. Simu and Awk killed their roles, and I can't wait to see more from them as these characters. The story was so compelling, and the theme of the movie was so unique and refreshing in an industry that usually white-washes Asian-lead films. I cannot stress enough how well they also executed the use of female roles to empower women to accomplish their goals. Katy and Xialing were along with Shang through the whole ride and played just as important of roles as he did. Lastly, the inclusion of Shang and Katy into the MCU longterm is such a good move on the part of Marvel. I am so ready for what's to come after that end credit scene, including the last one about The Ten Rings ;). 9/10 from me, Marvel is still out here killing the game. People who hate on this movie don't understand good cinema.",negative
386,"To start, Shang Chi is a film worth going to see. If you're a Marvel fan it'll be a film that you'll enjoy; story, links to the wider MCU, action, comedy, and visuals. Just take a look at the reviews on here and you get the idea that it's a v good MCU film, that is slightly different from others that we've seen.I thought to add a few things not mentioned in the reviews on here that struck me while I was watching;
a. The slow motion and music/sound during the slow Mo. Something I've noticed about Chinese cinema over the past 2 decades is the over use of slow Mo to try and be poignant or emotional. It's been overdone, especially with the slightly cheesey background music to labour the point. ShangChi leans heavily on these several times and I found myself rolling my eyes more than once. Admittedly you may not notice it.B. The CGI. I thought it wasn't great, particularly at the start in the forest fight and the bus scene. It got better though, and overall the climactic fight was well rendered, if a little disorientating.C. The 'eastern' mystical stuff. They tried to shoehorn in a couple of things but honestly it's kinda like an impression that a westerner would have about 'Eastern history and culture'. It reminded me a little bit of what Marvel did with The Ancient One (a Caucasian lady in Asian clothes), and the way Danny Rand tried to spout a few mystical phrases in Iron Fist.D. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Yuen Wah. Three major players in Chinese cinema going all the way back to the 80s (I think)... It was great to see them here, particularly Tony Leung who has some of the most expressive eyes in film (I know it's a weird thing to say, but he has) and Yuen Wah who was a classmate of Jackie Chan. I would have liked to have seen more of the latter to be honest and would recommend you check him, Jackie, Sammo Hung and Yuan Biao out on YouTube.E. The fight scenes. Overall they were very good, particularly the hand to hand on the bus (before the CGI). That one was sharp, aggressive and brilliantly choreographed. The one in the forest though!!! It's was one of that have been overdone in Chinese cinema, so an eye roller for me... ie a relationship developing as a result of a fight.F. The humour was great imo and the delivery was great overall.Like I said above it's worth seeing and you'll probably enjoy it. My girlfriend (who's not watch a whole lot of Asian cinema) did. I've seen a fair share of it, from the Shaw Brothers films up to modern day, so somethings did grate on me. Did I enjoy it though? Overall, yes.",negative
387,"Visually stimulating from beginning to end, funny, smart, and befitting the Marvel Canon!! Excellent film that's fun for the whole family! A TRUE MUST SEE!!!",positive
388,"As famed YouTuber Ryan George would put it, Wow (x4). This is simply an amazing movie with spectacular production value. I was thoroughly entertained throughout its duration. And I think most people will be, too. Definitely one of the best Marvel movies out there. Oh, and definitely stick around for the mid and post-credit scenes, they are totally worth it.",positive
389,Well what a brilliant way to start off the next phase. Honestly marvel never fails to impress visually stunning. Really good movie fun. Add in a little comedy likeable characters and good actors. Was a very fun entertaining great watch.,positive
390,"The journey of a self doubting and traumatized person into confident saviour of the world. Now add in some loyal characters who always believe in the protagonist's ability and some humour, now you have Marvel's good old formula for Solo origin movies.Marvel has perfected this formula and it works. It is fun to watch Simu Liu's Shang-Chi growing into the worthy hero to possess legendary ten rings. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's Wen wu easily dominates the screen presence and leaves lasting impression on the viewers. Ageless Michelle yeoh does her part very well and Awkwafina is....there.Besides the Captain America and the winter soldier, this movie has some of the best hand to hand combat scenes in the whole MCU. The Mid credits scene was a surprise and Marvel fans, Don't miss it.While the movie is not boring, it doesn't take risks and doesn't venture into unique and bold story telling like GOTG, Infinity war and Endgame. If you have watched both trailers for this movie, you pretty much know what's gonna happen after spending 15 mins into the movie.Overall, Shang-Chi is a worthy addition to the MCU (Or should I say MCM 😉? ) and a decent movie to visit theatres after two long years.",negative
391,"Shang-Chi is Marvel's ode to martial arts and easily the best Asian representation film since Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It also ranks as one of the best Marvel films ever made, owing no less to Destin Daniel Cretton's character-driven directing style, an engaging story, amazing fight choreography, warm humour, a competent cast, Marvel's trademark visual effects and an outstanding performance by Tony Leung in his first English language role. The film's climax - with dragons and monsters - feels somewhat cheesy after its brilliant first half. Overall, it is a fun movie for repeated viewings.",positive
392,It was fun and enjoyable which is rule number 1 for a good film. Has its flaws but I don't care I had a good time with it and brought in many possibilities to this large Universe of madness.,negative
393,"I give an automatic 1 to every Marvel movie. They are all the same. Boring, idiotic, propaganda. They have single handedly ruined the film industry. Well not single handedly. The propaganda has, and that's in many movies. But they have single handedly made what use to be a much anticipated, original movie, that comes out once or twice a year, just another bargain bin film. Their movies are paint by the numbers and rehashed over and over and over again. I absolutely despise these movies and comic books and anyone who fanboys them. When a person even likes them, that speaks a lot to who they are. Just dull, boring, morons. Mentally stunted and intellectually void. The day the Marvel Universe dies will be a great day. I just hope it comes soon.",negative
394,"Having been starved for a Marvel movie and after the fiasco that was Black Widow, I think many are rating this movie higher than it deserves.A running time of 2hr and 13 min felt more like 2 and a half hrs. Awkwafina, meant to be the comedic sidekick, was completely out of place. She had no skill set, could not speak Chinese and was not particularly funny. I did not like the pacing particularly the numerous flashbacks to the past. Instead of attempting to subvert our expectations by springing surprises on the audience as it relates to a character's character it would have worked better to have a linear timeline. Doc Ock was not shown to be evil out of the box and then through flashbacks is it explained why he is the way he is.Finally, I felt that cinematically you can see similarities between this movie and other martial arts movies released in the early 2000s (Hero, The Forbidden Kingdom) specifically in some fight scenes.",negative
395,"A friend saw this shortly after it came out and said he wouldn't mind rewatching it, leaving me rather surprised. A couple of days later another friend dragged us out to see this, at a 4dx screening, no less. I got burnt out on capeshit after ""Ant-Man"", but this looked possibly interesting enough to be enjoyable.Aside from the overwhelming shaking of the 4dx chairs, the film itself is a plothole-ridden nonsensical mess, led by unlikeable characters and a complete waste of its two most famous cast members, Ben Kingsley and Michelle Yeoh. As can be anticipated from modern high-budget films, it's also laden with impressive CGI and good-looking visuals, and the monsters are cool. It's just a shame that it's such a waste. The ratings must be artificially inflated as well, as there's no way anyone with an IQ higher than room temperature would actually think this is a good film. But let's get into some more details.Starting from the opening, we're introduced to our unremarkable protagonist and the annoying female lead. ""Katy"" is as useless, annoying, infantile, and uncharismatic as one could imagine. I couldn't have written a more grating character if I tried. On top of her, we're given some very awkward, stilted dialogue that was probably supposed to be cutesy or something, but fails dramatically. After the end of the first act, which terminates with the bus sequence, the film becomes slightly more palatable. Instead of cringing and facepalming and wondering why, exactly, I'd spent £16 on this trash, I could at least watch the thing.Then we get into the nonsensical. After his mother got killed by the mob, Shang-Chi trained hard for years before getting sent to avenge her death. He killed her murderer, but then decided to feel bad, run away to the US and abandon his ten-year-old sister whom he loved, after telling her he'd be back in three days. His sister, who ""taught herself better"" just by watching the real fighters train, ran away 6 years later and founded an underground fighting ring in Macau all by herself with no money or support from anyone. Right. Shang-Chi's dad didn't actually want to kill his kids when he sent his mercs to fight them (including the big guy with the blade-hand), he actually wants his children's help to find their mum, who's allegedly still alive. They run away from the dad, stealing some BMW hatchback instead of a Land Rover or a Jeep for a trip into the Chinese outback. Conveniently, the car's turn circle happens to be just the one needed to traverse a perilous ""living"" forest maze that ""eats"" stragglers. Our heroes find the late mum's village, train for ONE day, and defeat all evil, including the dangerous merc army bent on burning the village down.Nothing in the paragraph above, and little in the film in general, makes any sense, including the fact that the bad guys show up to the village---the village they want to slaughter the population of---with stun batons and shock crossbows. I guess assault rifles wouldn't have quite stood up to the good guys' ""dragon-forged"" staves. Katy, the annoying American-born character who looks significantly out of shape, trains archery for a handful of hours before letting a much cooler character get his soul sucked out (RIP Master Guang Bo, I'll remember you) before landing the single lucky arrow needed to dispatch the eldritch boss-monster from half a kilometre away. She'd never be able to draw a real bow, let alone hit any target at all.Shang-Chi himself also trains for a few hours before defeating his dad and his rings against all odds, but the flashbacks showing him training with his mum as a kid at least allow me to suspend disbelief sufficiently to go with it. What I can't go with is the fact that Shang-Chi takes a full ring-empowered gut punch beforehand, which propels him some fifty metres, and would have ruptured his spleen or stomach. He's dead, Jim. I don't care about your plot armour.The final sequence also included so much seat shaking (4dx) that I could barely follow what was going on with the eldritch monster. 4dx was fine in ""Alita: Battle Angel"", but whoever the poor sod responsible for programming this film's effects was, he must have been out of his mind.The worst part of this is that the story has potential and could have been handled better if someone actually tried to make it logical. What, am I supposed to ""turn my brain off""? I can't ""turn my brain off"" because I actually have one. As a writer, I'd be laughed out of the room if I were to write a script as nonsensical as this. Guess that doesn't apply to blockbusters for some reason...Michelle Yeoh is completely wasted in an insignificant role as Shang-Chi's aunt. Ben Kingsley is back as his ""Iron Man 3"" role, a dumb Englishman theatre actor providing comic relief alongside Katy; a role that I recall people perceived as an insult to the character of the Mandarin when ""Iron Man 3"" came out. The sole difference between his and Katy's jokes is that I actually chuckled at a couple of his.A 4.5 is what I'd give, and I'd probably round it up to a 5, as the visual spectacle is decent, albeit dragged way down by the sheer inanity of the script. This unnaturally high rating, however, merits rounding mine down. I can't accept the rating is real. If it is, then people must be too willing to slobber up all the flashy corporate sludge thrown their way, which would be saddening.",negative
396,"The first 1/2 is fantastic, it's right up there with the best of the MCU, I feared the action would follow suit with previous marvel films with nothing but quick cuts and shaky cam but it doesn't and it's brilliant. Cast are fantastic Tony Leung the high point for me. At this point to me the film was an easy 8/10Unfortunately, the second half isn't as tight, the story becomes a little too fantastical ending in a god awful CGI mess that has become all too common with the MCU bringing the score down.It's a shame as the first half is generally fantastic, but I don't see myself rushing to see it again now.",negative
397,"Excellent Marvel movie that teaches us the history of Shang-Chi. The fight scenes are grand, the story fascinating, and the other scenes are divine. In short, a magical film.",positive
398,"While not in the class of Iron Man, GOTG, or Black Panther as top MCU origin films this film was extremely fun and offered a different type of MCU film. I would put this film above the first Dr. Strange & Ant-man movies and perhaps right on the level of the first Captain America & Black Widow films. IronMan, GOTG, Black Panther, Thor, and Spiderman Homecoming had better plots but Shang-Chi offered a ton of heart.The fight scenes were amazingly done and the climax of the film was actually visually beautiful. Some reviews said it was CGI heavy but i actually felt it was just right.When comparing this to other recent Asian led cast and stories i like this film a ton more then Mulan, SnakeEye, and Crazy Rich Asians. Highly recommend!!!'",neutral
399,"Like able. Not perfect, but oozing charm and fun. Akwafina's character doesn't have much of an arc but she's fun. Shang is a great lead and is fun. Some aspects feel not fleshed out enough but the good pacing helps me forget that.It's fun. It's not the most intricately shaped or crafted story but it's good enough.8/10 not enough Wong.",negative
400,"Visually outstanding, the choreography of the fight scenes was one of the greatest I ever watched in recent movies. Michelle Yeoh own every single scene that she was on it and Awkwafina was funny as ever. And the story? Great, some plot twists and with great clues to follow the next phase of the MCU!",positive
401,"... but this is a hit. They somehow succeeded expanding the vast MCU without really forcing it (it goes to show you the richness of American pocket and world culture can go a long way). This is a solid movie, with great action sequences and CGI that delivers. Mind you, SHANG-CHI is not the same without the mesmerizing Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh (when he doesn't fight, the title character is just OK and Awkwafina still isn't funny). Do not wait to watch it on TV because you should experience it at cinema first.",negative
402,"For the first half of the film, I really thought Marvel had nailed it. The production felt very Marvel-like with spectacular visuals and effects, alongside an emotional development of the plot that draws you in greatly. It was amazing, I would give the first half a 9/10 for the story and character development. The story-building is done so beautifully with amazing cinematography and fight choreography. I really felt the chemistry between characters and began to invest in their relationships and root for them in the very beginning. The movements in action-based scenes flow so smoothly but powerfully that it was such a joy to watch. The family drama in the first half is convincing and emotionally wrecking, I'm so glad MCU invests in the villain Wen-wu (Tony Leung)'s story as much as Shang-Chi's.However, the CGI towards the end of the film (when they arrive at the village of Ta Lo) RUINED IT for me. Magical creatures are involved and the whole thing becomes Disney-like and more like a teenage/young adult fantasy film than a Marve film. The design of the creatures felt very Disney: the 'good' creatures are fluffy and cute, the 'evil' creatures look like - clichely - bats and spiders etc. The story here is still okay - not the best but definitely logical enough to enjoy. The worst is the battle between CGI creatures and humans... During the climactic point where Shang-Chi was fighting along with the dragon, I was reminded of Harry Potter and his adventures. Tbh the dragons in HP's The Goblet of Fire felt even much more dangerous and exciting than the creatures in this film. The CGI creatures and their interactions with the humans in this film are that BAD. I feel greatly disappointed in MCU because of this, making the whole atmosphere of the film more Disney than MCU. I love innovations and creativity but I came here to watch a Marvel film instead of a Disney film. I really would prefer them to focus more on Shang-Chi vs. Wen-wu in the final battle. I was invested in both characters so much I wish I could've seen more of them.",negative
403,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is very different from all previous Marvel movies, which is a good thing. I was a little worried at first that the film might not live up to the success Marvel pushed to give, but the film was actually spectacular and very entertaining. Good story, good acting, excellent character development, the action and choreography are outstanding, some funny moments, beautiful cinematography, and the VFX are a major step-up from previous Marvel films. This film was almost like the Aquaman of the MCU because it was a fun experience seeing it on the screen and presenting fans with something entirely new and unfamiliar. This movie is practically flawless. Can't wait to see Shang-Chi in future Marvel movies.",positive
404,"This Movie was AMAZING ,beautiful to look at and had awesome action scenes as well as gripping story that at times even pulled on your heart strings. This is hands down one of the best MARVEL films that's ever come out so far. WOW, WHAT A DARN MOVIE!!!!",positive
405,Another very mediocre movie from this dying 'universe' but some fight scenes are quite good and visual it's mostly ok too. Better than Capt Marvel. Hence the two points.,positive
406,"Marvel's newest solo film that introduces an iconic hero from thier vast collection of heroes is certainly for the newer fans that didn't grow up with ""The Master of Kung-Fu"". Even Stan Lee (who was in charge of the company but didn't create Shang-Chi) has admitted he was a comic rip-off of Bruce Lee in looks and style. Adding a mystical and possible alien influence was in my view a mistake and not true to the character's story. Nor the reimaging of The Mandarin, which I found to be disappointing. Aside from the tired storylines which have become common in these Marvel films, the ending was a little over the top. Aside from these criticisms, I'll give kudos to a good cast and wonderful cinematography. If I ever get a faithful adaption of a Marvel comic I grew up with, I might be shocked. I am coming to the conclusion that these films are only for those under 30, since I don't recognize the heroes or villains. Not the worse film in the Marvel universe but not the best.",negative

Then someone else teaches them that, just like the kinder person who they are upset about said, stop using anger to solve your problems.Apparently the moral is that women who are younger, more beautiful, smarter, more powerful, and kinder shouldn't settle.

411,"I loved this movie.Mandarin
I thought it was great getting to see the Mandarin after the Iron Man 3 portrayal and even seeing Trevor Slattery return was one of my favourite moments in Recent MCU. Tony Leung was incredible as Wenwu and delivered a compelling performance, he brought the emotional, yet unsettling character to life so well, he was amazing!Shang-Chi
You can really tell when an actor is passionate about a role, and this is one of these times. Simu Liu is so passionate about this character and it really pays off. He brings a great performance, some of my favourite scenes are with him and Wenwu (Tony Leung) having an emotional mental battle. He was great!Katy Awkwafina usually annoys me in movies, but not so much in this one. She is actually quite funny a lot of the time (apart from the forced MCU humour) and delivered a good sidekick performance!Trevor Slattery
I loved having Trevor back. He was hilarious in this movie, and I love Ben Kingsleys portrayal of this character.Xialing
I thought she was pretty cool, it's cool to see what's happening with her going forward.Overall just a great movie, the colour grading in this movie is gorgeous too! The choreography is the best we've seen in the MCU thanks to Brad Simpson (RIP) and really feels authentic to the old Jackie movies. I absolutely loved the Chinese culture in this movie, it was amazing to see it all, especially the dragons. The music was also incredible, might be my favourite MCU score!Overall 9/10!",positive
412,"The 3rd cinema visit this year (2021) for me brought a delightful marvel film.I REALLY enjoyed this film. It has it all: inspired martial arts, humor , character developments, emotions, and its also quite spectacular, even if we may thinnk we've ""seen it all already"" with so much visual effects heavy movies coming out over these past ten years or so.It makes you marvel (pun intended) and laugh,
It has a heart of goodness.I can VERY MUCH recommend seing this movie in a cinema.",negative
413,"The people who give the movie a 1-4/10 reviews are having an agenda against this movie, and they are not honest or objective about it at all.The comic version of the mandarin is different, the power of the ten rings are different, does it make he movie bad? Not at all.The ""Marvel formula"" is present here, but it shows a different part of the MCU and it is just like the Black Panther, an important part of world building.The theme of the movie is about family, i expected it focused more on the action, but it had a unique balance between the story telling and the action scenes, you get them both at the same time and it makes sense.I write this review only because it is a very petty thing to downplay or misrepresent a movie just because of an agenda, and i see that a lot nowdays.The actors were good, the mandarin, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai was the main reason i watched this movie and he did not disappointed me.Should you watch this movie? I think you can enjoy this movie, it is not a ""masterpeice"" but it holds its own weight just fine.",negative
414,Incredible start to finish! Cast is perfect! Mind blowing special effects. Can't give enough praise! Go see this!,positive
415,"I'm not going to downplay this movie for it's action, visuals and comedy (but not as much comedy as you'd expect from a Marvel movie). If you just want an entertaining movie, I think the MCU has figured that much out at this point. Oddly enough, Awkwafina is the best part of this movie. I like her better in this than other things I've seen her in.The main character, Shang-Chi, really sells this movie. Simu Liu knocks it out of the park with his perfomance. He knows how to play an everyman. His chemistry with Awkwafina works well and are the best scenes in the movie. I thought it was interesting that, like many other marvel characters, he's a superhero who could be a regular guy walking down the street. You wouldn't know unless you knew his backstory (and believed it). I also liked the whole transition where he faces his true identity in finally confronting his father (the main antogonist).So the weakpoints, it's just as you'd expect. The villain is about as 2-dimensional as it gets. I didn't really care for him even as the credits rolled. The fact that he was Shang-Chi's father is literally the only thing making him relevant to the story or remotely interesting. Even the whole Ten Rings super power didn't completely sell me. It looked cool but beyond that, it was a guy with metal rings on his arms...which makes him...the most powerful man in world history? Sure, whatever.The other (and I would say biggest) weakpoint is the story. Like I began this review, this has great visuals, action and is a generally entertaining movie. BUT...I can't help but think there are Marvel screenwriters who are copy/pasting stories from previous Marvel movies. The third act was borderline ripped from Black Panther. It's a shame because I think this movie, in a vacuum, is really something special without elements feeling regurgitated from the MCU's back catalogue.Look, I get it. Sometimes you want the same thing. I'm not going to stop you from watching Marvel, Pixar and Disney cartoon movies (or their live-action remakes). But I personally have never heard of Shang-Chi from the comics, barely knew of most of these actors and just feel less invested than I was pre-Avengers: Endgame. It feels odd waiting for X-Men, Deadpool, Wolverine, Iron Fist, Fantastic 4, Blade, New Avengers and others to join the MCU but we're watching this while we wait. Do we need this many MCU movies? I guess that's not for me to decide.",negative
416,"Shang Chi what can I say other than the first hour was enjoyable with the whole backstory of the two siblings and the origins of the ten rings and its rival clan, the martial arts was also great.....but then it did what I was afraid it would do in the 2nd half of the movie and that was become a poor version and knock off of crouching tiger hidden, with silly wire work and theatrics that makes it out of place that it was like two different movies got cut and stitched together.",negative
417,"This film is everything I wanted to be, and it's actually even better than I expected. The action sequences are awesomely bad-A, the jokes and comedic scenes are hilarious and never unfunny, the cgi is great, the emotional scenes hit hard, and the cinematography is gorgeous. And it's also something fresh and unique, and it doesn't feel like a Marvel movie (if that makes sense) which I like, and it also brings something new to the MCU. Overall, this film is fantastic, and sometimes even emotional, and I recommend you go watch this at the cinema for the full experience. 10/10.",neutral
418,"All I can say is ""wow"". I loved the cinematography, I was amazed by the choreography and the fact it wasn't hidden or obscured through camera angles like some previous movies, and I now love Simu Liu and think he is an incredible addition to the MCU, along with Awkwafina.The ""villain"" of the story, Wenwu, played by the amazing Tony Leung, had incredible character depth and was certainly not a stereotypical bad guy.Aside from a couple of awkward phrases, I loved everything about this movie and am so glad I was able to support it during their opening weekend. If it wasn't COVID, I would've went to see it again by now. Highly recommend.",positive
419,"Not sure what all the hype is about as far as non Asian movie goers are concerned. The movie was ok at best. It has some great fight scenes, ok comedy, and great cinematography,(it's Marvel after all) but over it's kinda dumb. The first part of the movie is pretty good, the second half all the way to the end is pretty ridiculous. I won't give away anything here. My wife is Asian, so I went with her family to see it last night. It was all Asians in the theatre besides a few white people. I asked my sister-in-law why she liked it so much, and her reason was ""because I'm Asian."" That's exactly how Obama became President, and why black panther did well at the box office, because minorities support minorities whether the finished product is good or not. It's rather annoying, and I don't care who gets offended reading this, because it's fact! All the big babies will down vote this, but they know I'm right. Marvel needs to get back to making awesome movies like Thor Ragnarok, and Endgame. The Hulk movies, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Shang-Chi ain't it, sorry not sorry.",negative
420,It had a lot of funny scenes and great action scenes. The movie was great.,positive
421,"The movie is very entertaining, with a great cast. The fighting scenes are intense and beautiful. There are no noticeable plot holes. Tony Leung is amazing as alawys, and Sim Liu did a great job too.",positive
422,"So happy to see movies like this in theaters again. The ones that give you that satisfying feeling at the end. Honestly don't know if is tight to chinese culture but look quite respectful to it imho. Also didn't know about the character before and the novelty didn't disappoint as instantly become one of the best heroes origin film both DC and Marvel of course. Most of the cast is unfamiliar to me but nothing that demerits the product, on the contraire quite surprised by the good performances. The figths are very well choreographed to the point to bring back the sensations of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. The effects are so well made that is very hard to find a defect to complain about. Mostly flawless to me. Remarkable the smoothness of the water scenes. Nature and creatures scenes are very well done too. Beautiful scenes appears with some regularity. Sound is terrific too. Is a Marvel movie and conserve the tone of all the previous ones. Enjoyable, interesting, not dark, well paced and of course well done. I give a 9 to counterpart the ones giving 6 star or less, but definitely is a solid 8 to me. Hope more movies like this appears more often as make super enjoyable the visit to the theatre (3D Imax worth it!)",positive
423,"The ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Wakanda"" layering on of endless flashbacks and ""ancient legends"" gets a bit thick (and sags noticeably in the back half), but overall this addition of an Asian superhero story hits all the right notes, powered mainly by 2 early bravura action sequences (scaffolding on the side of a high rise mirror glass tower is especially well rendered). The performances are solid, if not exactly groundbreaking (Michelle Teoh especially has little new to do), and the direction is serviceable. But the whole thing ends in yet another CGI heavy big bass fight that is just... well, way too predictable. Snazzy post credit sequence teases Dr Strange but also adds more mystery to the 10 Rimgs... which is becoming Marvel's staple out: always teasing better content next time. Even that's wearing a bit thin.",negative
424,"I'm a huge Marvel fan and they continue to disappoint in this phase. It's all about shallow virtue signaling and not about character anymore. Why on earth did they decide to go in this direction after Endgame? This movie had it's moments but gets lost and it's on woke lack of depth. I pray this isn't the end of the marvel cinematic universe because we all enjoyed it so much. If it is the end, it was a great 11 year run. Don't waste your time with this nonsense.",negative
425,If this is considered a good Marvel movie then Marvel is in big trouble. Completely unoriginal.,positive
426,"Went in with low expectation, of maybe cultural butchering or what not. Came out infatuated with Wenwu. Where did all the serious talent like Tony Leung go at international stage??! This is also the first Marvel film that felt very Disney to me. The brand is there. Overall the story is great especially till the father vs son fight. The chinese dragon, and lions? Delicious choice, love it! But, the CGI monsters as main climax villain... yuck. What a boooooring turn of events. Booo Disney and your boring aliens and the unknown are bad. Oh, like 100 years ago, ooh Asians bad cause they are so alien, anything alien baaaaad. Main bad.",negative
427,"Brilliant movie with brilliant actors!! I love the connection of Shang-Chi to the MCU. It was action packed, funny and brilliant storyline. Can't wait for a sequel!!",positive
428,"Very impressed with the entire movie. Great visual effects, action scenes were on point. Well written story. Definitely a must see.",positive
429,Wow one of the best marvel movies i have seen so far!,neutral
430,"Movie was jam packed with great choreography , visual effects and story.Some parts pacing was too slow but in general a great movie!",positive
431,"Honestly i wasn't expecting something big like infinity war but i have to admit it was a very good movie. Of course, the movie isn't perfect.I thought that if I don't know the character then I won't have fun, it was quite the opposite. There was a lot of action and a great connection with Ironman also the post-credits scene was stuffing into the armchair.Now just wait for more Marvel movies.",negative
432,"The movie as a whole is a decent watch. It has some great ideas and fight scenes, but it all just seems a little shallow, and like the movie is scare of commit to anything so it just ends up falling like none of the great potential ever amounts to any thing.The actor who portrays Shang Chi does a good job, but he unfortunately does not get much depth to work with, he starts and ends his character ark at basically the same spot, he does not really get any moments to express any real emotion.For me there are 3 main problems.1. The sister character is only there to show a female character can be a badass...""we know, don't cram it down our throats"" it makes it feel forced, and takes away the impact of the character. But the main problem of focusing so much on her is that the main character in the story never really gets enough time to develop a character.2. The Mandarin, never feels really intimidating og loving, they try to be so middle of the road on everything with this character, that he neither feels believeable as any of those opposites or as ""real person"" in general. A shame because I don't think the actor is to blame, it is simply poor writing and directing.3. Shang Chi, doesn't feel like he has much impact on the story, especially in the second half, where the is more focus on secondary roles than him. And his impact on the final battle is minimal at best. The first half of the movie is clearly the stongest, and goes kinda downhill from there.There is one special cameo though, that is sure to delight and give some laughs.Over all it was worth a watch, but not much more than that.",negative
433,A marvel movie with dragons and martial arts I liked the story and thought the vfx were really good.,positive
434,"The action is the movie's biggest selling point. The hand to hand combat is done exceptionally well and the use of the environment and camera movement added to the flow and intensity of each scene.Character development and interactions is also fine. The only criticism I have is how the final fight got a bit too CGI-heavy. It really didn't need the super fantastical elements and definitely took away the character development the story was building up to. It kind of just felt like the higher-ups said a Marvel movie needs something grandiose despite the rest of the film was kept grounded.Other than this, and the fact that a side character was able to pull a MVP hit out of thin air, the movie is very enjoyable. There is some truly breathtaking scenes and there's plenty of memorable martial arts scenes to go around. Growing up with these kung fu movies, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",negative
435,"When Marvel first announced its Phase 4, I admit that I wasn't exactly excited about Shang-Chi. I had never even heard of the hero, so I was a lot more hyped for Spiderman and Doctor Strange than a complete unknown.Watching the movie, I was pleasantly surprised. Simu Liu is very likable as the main character, while Tony Leung is a big name in China and he demonstrates why. The man is a criminal who trained his own child as an assassin, yet through his acting you still feel sympathy for him when he broods over his lost love.The fighting scenes are also exceptionally well done and visually the movie is stunning, trying to incorporate some oriental elements into the MCU.Sure there are some woke snippets here and there, they sadly seem mandatory for any movie these days. Things like Katy mastering archery in a couple of days or Shang-Chi's sister teaching herself combat because their father wouldn't train a girl and despite that, somehow being on the main character's level. But you can overlook these with a little effort.If there is one thing I did not enjoy, it's the scenes with the dragon. I feel that it bogged down the movie with an unnecessary cgi-fest. For me, it would have served the movie a lot better if the story focused on pure combat and the 10 rings themselves. I would have also liked to see Shang-Chi struggle more with his upbringing. It would have made his character a lot more interesting and nuanced than presenting a child assassin as a well adjusted typical American.Despite the above points which in my eyes are missed opportunities, the movie was definitely better than I expected and the mere fact that I look forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi, makes me count this as a win for Marvel.",positive
436,I don't care about this because I want something nicer & cooler.,negative
437,My thoughts on Shang-Chi are that this was a really good movie and it is actually one of the better Marvel movies. I really enjoyed this movie. The fight choreography was really great and it almost reminded me of crouching tiger in some scenes. It also gave me some Jackie Chan movie vibes in some parts like the way Shang chi fought. It really connected to the marvel universe really well I thought and it also expands it as well. The acting was top notch all around. I thought I was going to hate awkwafina but she actually did a great job she was really funny and she could get emotional in some scenes. A lot of the comedy landed but there was some minor jokes that weren't funny but I got passed those and the other jokes made up for it.the Mandarin was a really intimidating figure. I really thought he could destroy anyone. The big fight scene at the end was really awesome and it's a huge spectacle that had me on the edge of my seat. I loved how they implemented the Asian culture into the films plot. It also ties in some threads from pass movies that really made me glad to finally have answers for. The cgi was amazing and it was very awe inspiring to watch. This was way better than the last marvel movie and I really want to see more of Shang-chi in the future. I give Shang-chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings a 9/10.,negative
438,"This really is a good movie, particularly if you like martial arts fight scenes. It has a bit of everything, a good sense of humour, great fight scenes and even a bit of fantasy mixed in.The two lead characters were particularly good. I really liked how they mixed the American and Chinese cultures throughout the movie.The fight scenes were epic and there were plenty of them, particularly when they involved the 10 rings!There were only a couple of things that I wasn't keen on. First, the appearance from Ben Kingsley (who I'm a big fan of) didn't work in my opinion. It wasn't entirely random, those that have watched the iron man movies will know this but it appeared to be an attempt to add some comedy value to the movie which just didn't work at all. People who haven't seen the iron man series will probably think it was clueless.The second was the inevitable woke storyline (that seems compulsory with all hollywood movies now) that they had to slip in. A cliché one, girl doesn't get treated equally to the boys and so has to become better than them *sigh*.Those things aside, I really enjoyed this movie and it was great to see at the cinema.Tip: There is an end scene after the credits roll as IN ALL MARVEL MOVIES. The cinema put the lights on as they rolled but we knew one would come. We were the only 2 in the entire cinema that stayed and watched it.",negative
439,"If you love Marvel, Mcu, disney, Asians martial arts and movies in general. YOU WILL LOVE THIS. Man what an amazing story, screenplay, action and emotional film. And the fantasy elements were epic and it was not what I expected. He. Shang-Chi is my new favorit hero. Ofc I watch everything and love everything thar Marve and disney does with the Mcu but it was awesome because I was born watching Jackie chan, Bruce Lee etc. It was little slow in the middle but good slow not bad slow, thanks to the story and direction.",positive
440,"With the natural expectations weighted on this movie, it was quite incredible. Plot was surprising/neat and the fighting was just amazing. I thought it was respectful of Eastern media and really praised a few cultures together. Aquafina also did well to be enjoyable but not annoying. Very well done.",positive
441,"Wow, I am so underwhelmed with this movie. I can't be bothered writing a review. This movie is boring, the characters such, the actors are uncharismatic.Disney has done it again! They are experts in dull, uninspiring, talentless garbage woke BS. Yay!",negative
442,"Before anyone thinks I am a straight white male who is not allowed to have opinions- let me tell you I am asian myself. Now the movie is truly overrated. Action is good, Virtue signaling was limited but not absent. Cliche MCU formula really is off putting. The only novelty was the looks of the actors. I did not get overly bored but I would not have missed much if I did not watch it.",negative
443,"I nearly fell asleep in the first 15 min of the movie then it picked up a little,after that it was so boring i got up and left half way through the movie.",negative
444,"Very impressive debut for a superhero flick coming in from the cold! In a competitive landscape of Marvel leads, Simu Liu is a likeable hero and Akwafina is a great foil. Superb supporting cast and very good writing (and production notes, iykwim). This one has legs, and unlikely to shrink in an ensemble.",positive
445,"I watched it in cinema, with bunch of jerks who wanted to ruin my impression of this film. And.. they failed the mission. I enjoyed the film so much! A lot of LotR vibes, but more like Hobbit to me (you know, fantasy world, city, lake, the rock, dragon from the mountain). Warm nostalgia about those Jackie Chan's action movies from childhood... and very, very beautiful locations! Nice cameos, like Abomination, Wong etc. Ben Kingsley was awesome as well!",positive
446,"A great introduction to a new Mcu hero, great marvel humor and can not wait to see more. They did the back story justice with this fresh take on the 10 rings.",positive
447,Its your average Marvel movie to the last bit. Go see it if you want to be bored and slightly entertained.I cannot be too bothered about this.,negative
448,"Marvel have churned out hit after hit with the first 3 phases but this feels something different! A great film, great action sequences, good casting, a few surprises and cameos! Looking forward to this character progressing withing the marvel universe!",positive
449,"It's great...! Really...
this review is too short.",positive
450,Really cool costumes. Fighting was alright. Plot was boring and the characters weren't challenged very much. Wasted dragons. Movie would've been better without akwafina.,negative
451,"If only marvel gave them more budget, the cgi could be more beautiful than this. The acting, the plot , the action are soooooo beautiful.",positive
452,"This movie had it all. It had great action and humor (which you would expect from a Marvel movie), but it was also so well-layered with complex characters, compelling themes, and respect for Asian culture. I found myself laughing and crying at this movie. I also loved the guest appearance from an old character long forgotten and some amazing creatures. This movie deserves all the praise it can get.",positive
453,"Sorry. Kung Fu not my thing. Action sequences too fast to keep up with, end battle too busy and fast to keep track of who where doing what?If you didn't have an idea of the connections with the rings, then would be lost as to how this fits with Marvel at all....except for mid credits trailer.For me, below par, too busy and mediocre at best.",negative
454,Can't wait to see what else is to come from Shang Chi.Fantastic from start to finish!Well worth the watch.,positive
455,"Amazing visuals, phenomenal fight choreography and a genuinely interesting story. I never knew about the character before but Shang Chi has already become a favourite of mine. I really hope he shows up in Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness.",negative
456,Action would last A few minutes and then back to talking for 20.Got old pretty fast and didn't need every back story shown for everyone after it was told by A character either.,negative
457,"This was a risk making a movie starring a mostly Asian cast, and i have to say that it paid off! Simu Liu was truly perfect casting! He not only got the essence of the character, making him relatable and likeable, but it seemed that he helmed much of the action scenes. There were multiple wide shots of hand to hand combats that absolutely blew my mind. I could not stop smiling!The director did an absolutely fantastic job leading this film. I just wished the 2nd act of the movie was paced a bit quicker. There was some set up during the second act that I wish perhaps came at the beginning. But this is a very very minor critique, and it may just be a me thing.All in all, this is the type of movie I want to pay to see. Please Hollywood, make more movies like this: movies with heart and conviction in the craft!",negative
458,"I usually like to post my thoughts straight after seeing something new, either good or bad, but this time I just didn't care enough to bother. I just felt flat at the end. I'm sure there are plenty who enjoyed it, but the plethora of super high scores is weird. Even if you want to turn your brain off and enjoy the visuals, it's still not that good. It's actually quite dull.The acting is... fine. With the exception of some of Liu's scenes, the whole movie's had a complete charisma bypass. And then there's Awkwafina's performance - not as bad as I expected, but that was still some strange casting.Who knows, if they'd chopped half an hour and tightened up the story a bit, it might have worked better. But instead it was a bloated, CGI heavy snorefest. Unless Eternals is a surprise hit, I'm really not liking where the MCU is heading post-Endgame.",negative
459,It was a rollercoaster ride all along. I'm not a big MCU fan but this one has to be respected..Shang-chi gave different vibes every 10 min. After a few laughs a serious scene comes long and in the middle again a laughing moment...it was a fresh movie to watch and would surely recommend it.,negative
460,FINALLY!!!!I was super excited when I saw the trailer for this movie and it did not disappoint. About time some Asian superhero's are being showcased.,neutral
461,"Let me just say I didn't know what to expect going into this movie, but I'm glad I bought the tickets. The story was amazing and the fighting scenes were really good choreographed and just overall top tier camerawork, the actor who played him is amazing and the movie was amazingly funny definitely worth watching.",positive
462,"69/100Shang-Chi is, at its core, a people pleasing Marvel movie. Nothing more, nothing less. Due to this, there isn't really all too much to say about this one.Storywise, it was simple and unchallenging, following Shang-Chi as he attempts to prevent the end of the world. Standard fare for most action films. The characters and their motivations all feel flat, outside of Shang-Chi and Katy, who provide a fun duo for the first two acts of the film. As with almost every Marvel film, it's swamped in CGI, leading to it being visually inseparable from the rest of the catalogue. The fight choreography felt fun, with the two types starkly contrasting: the CTHD inspired duels, and the modern, almost dance-like brawls. Outside of a passing character appearance and a post-credit scene, there is no real reference to the overall MCU, leaving me thinking this film would have worked better as a fully standalone one, especially for an otherwise relatively unknown character. My main complaint is with the story, and how little happened in the runtime. They could have developed characters more, they could have touched more on the 1000 years the father was alive and how it affected him, they could have put more into telling the story of the soul-sucking dragon and where it is trapped. But none of this happens. This film is, yes, alright, but it had potential to be so much better.I can't be arxed to paragraph this, so have this all in one big lump.",negative
463,"What does the Ironman, Thor, etc. Movie had in common?Some newbie (yet to be famous) guy, and with great animation, action sequences, screenplay, character arcs, some old and established actors, great camera & direction works and at last the happy endings.Same with this one. I liked the movie, a great experience in a long time, post covid.Must watch it in theatre or with family and kids.You would love and enjoy watching it.Marvel is the boss and they have proofed 20+ times.",positive
464,"The MCU's newest movie has the same things the other movies in the series have-by that i mean great humour, great action scenes, and just the fun factor that makes all of the movies so beloved. The film feels like it has a couple of 'acts', and each has something else to offer. The action scenes are very fun to watch and the fight scenes are really well choreographed. There are a lots of nice looking locations and colors in the film, and it has a nice Asian feel to it. There are also great quiet scenes between Shaung and his family. The characters are great, Shaung and his sister being warriors with troubled lives, their father being determined to bring back his wife back despite what his son says, and Katy, Trevor and Morris are all really hilarious. Also, the movie is just fun to watch. I largely reccomend it.",positive
465,"Marvel Origins story are amazing but this one breaks the line. The writing, the humor, the comedy everything is perfect here. The directors made all the best choices which made the movie incredible.",positive
466,"A solid origin story for MCU's newest Avenger.If I were to summarize how this movie made me feel, I would say it was like a crossover of Raya and the Last Dragon, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and a mega blockbuster Jackie Chan film but with the never-tiring humor of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the first time in forever, I didn't need English subtitles for English conversations in an MCU film. Thank God for Asian-Americans haha.I want to leave out Simu Liu and Shang-Chi himself in this review because I think this movie is more about Tony Leung's character, the Mandarin, than it is about Shang-chi. This movie's central themes are grief, loss, moving on and finding passion in life. All these are heavier and deeper with The Mandarin than with Shang-chi. This film is like a beloved ancient Asian tale brought to life, crafted with respect and participated by the probably the best people for their roles.So many familiar faces appear in this movie, and it is always nice to remember which films in the franchise you saw some characters in and how they are all connected with each other.I am so excited for what Shang-chi can offer from here on out to the rest of the MCU. Asians really are winning with this representation in the Avengers. This movie is a homage to many superhero fans who are Asian. Asian kids finally have superheroes in the MCU they can see themselves in.",positive
467,I'm just in love with this movie it's so good it's a masterpiece it's so good it has great action scenes the Villain is amazing simu is fantastic akwafina is amazing it has a great representation the female characters are incredible everything is great.,positive
468,This movie reminds me of the old kung fu movies of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee. The fight sequences are extremely well shot and choreographed and Wenwu might be one of the best villains of the MCU. Simu liu is a very charismatic actor and I'm hoping he gets his own sequel. Definitely recommend everyone to give this movie a watch.,positive
469,"Greatly done movie with great characters. The best part of this movie is it's action, beautiful visually and made to perfection. This is not only one of my new favourite Marvel movies but also one of my favourite superhero movies.",positive
470,"A super smooth blend of magic, martial arts and mythology. The chemistry between the two leads is spot on and it's hilarious. Some of the best choreographey in the MCU and a really memorable villain. If you want the full experience, watch in a cinema and I'd personally recommend watching Iron Man 3 first.",positive
471,I've just got out the unlimited screening 10 out of 10 best marvel action origin film of MCU if u love action fantasy film this is Ur film.,positive
472,This is definitely the best Marvel movie I've seen in a while and probably the most un-Marvel feeling one too. The fight seems are incredible - the bus fight being the stand out. Fantastic choreography and heavily influenced by old martial arts movies. The CGI throughout is amazing too as you'd expect from Marvel. I felt the amount of comedy was just right with Ben Kingsley smashing it again as Trevor - superb. As others have commented there are some pacing issues in the second half but overall it's a fun ride so enjoy! The first end credits scene is worth holding on for but don't bother with the second!,positive
473,"I loved every bit of this movies...
It keeps you on the edge of your seat...
Loved Katy, she is probably the total backbone of this movie...Amazing action...Everything delivered for which Marvel's stands for.!!Woowwwww!!!",positive

475,"Another global treath.Another villain that gonna kill the entire reallity. (Speaking abault this, whats the name of the villain again? Oh, I cant remember.)
Another secret organization that ""shape the history"", ""take down government"" bla bla bla.Its not a good movie. The script its bad, some characters are forced into the movie. Even the CGI, too much CGI, and It is not a good CGI.",negative
476,"Great movie to bring renaissance to a fantasy Kung Fu movie Genre, and it kept its Asian roots in the story and characters. Shang Chi is a great movie for its MCU introduction. I haven't been in movie theaters for about 4-5 years. For this, I decided to go out and see in movie theaters, and I'm happy that I did.",positive
477,"Incredibly boring and indifferent film, with stereotypical characters and a predictable story, following the superheroes formula. I watched the 3-D version, which looked like bad animation and completely distanced me from the film. The only redeeming qualities were a few inspired shots and the inclusion of some decent actors -- especially the wonderful Michelle Yeoh.",negative
478,Visually stunning. Awesome fight scenes. Many Easter Eggs.,positive
479,"I had very few expectations from this one, given the fact that it was an origin story with a character I know zero facts about. But let me say this, it competes with the Avengers movies when comes to cinematography, visuals and action sequences.By far the best Marvel movie in the recent years, that puts many titles from its portfolio to shame.The visuals are a blast, a true eye candy experience. There are a lot of new elements that Marvel seemed to experience with and it worked out perfectly. The choreography is spot on, as the fighting sequences are among the best I've seen, and combined with a good score, it turns out to be a very enjoyable seeing on the big screen. I think it's mandatory to watch Shang-Chi on the biggest screen you can get to.",positive
480,"It's nothing but a larger than life chinese martial art movie in fantasy, action, adventure genre.....No way upto Marvel standard.....Yeah budget is high so the action sequences, VFX and graphics are great.....but the story or the theme is same as of those fantasy action adventure chinese movies.... it's nothing new.Presenting a old dish adding some spices in new plate.... that's it.I personally don't like it.",positive
481,"Oh is it beautiful.The coregraphy, the fights, the landscape, the colors...The story and the script is previsible, it's good sometimes to have something classic and there it works.I always though marvel universe movies have less fight , all reunited, with a classic Hong Kong movies such John Woo ones.Here my toughs are listened and this is easely the most fight based of all MCU movies ever.I had a great time. Great subjects, editing, actors.I have preferred this one globally than Black Widow because i see and live what i was expecting and even more.",neutral
482,"Movie is a Great treat for all the fans, this reminded us of last Marvel magic in theatre, but here is a twist, this one was fresh and different with some Sad themes,The Plot is fine but the, ACTION & the CGI dominated this Movie, its was so good and really its the strength of Marvel Studios and they have used it in a great way, Lots of Astonishing Scenes and Visuals are there which ll blow your mind.Casting and performance were also great, Awkwafina killed her role, Simu was also great, But Tony as the mandarian was the best. Movie is little fast paced because they wanted to show much and you can't show Everything in just 2 hours.But it was great to back at cinema along with this movie...",positive
483,"Honestly, I'm very happy to write a good review for a change!! It's been almost 2 years since anything decent came out ( tenet was amazing too) but pretty much everything was garbage! I thought that bar of quality has fallen so low and no way back up!But HOLY COW!!!!! Everything about this movie is great! It's funny, it's beautiful, has great writing, great CG, amazing fighting scenes, and even magical creatures!Neutral non political proper comic book story!Well done Mr. Kevin & Louis!Please keep up! And thank you 🙏",positive
484,"The first part of the first act is awkward due to the inclusion of Awkwafina. While i enjoy her in many other roles, her character here is executed poorly. Sometimes the scene calls for her to react with a little more reality, a little more urgency but you can tell she's staring at green tennis ball. This pops up through the rest of the movie.It just didn't hit the emotional marks enough for me to care. The ending fell in to the usual tropes of too much on-screen mayhem.It is gorgeous. The choreography is spectacular. It's still a fun spectacleIt may, like other MCU flicks, grow on me with repeated viewings.",negative
485,"Seriusly !I didn't even expected much from this movie.I lost intrest in MCU after END-GAME , I only watch phase-4 MCU just for the sake of continuation , but not whole-heartedly.But when i saw this kickass movie , goosebumps ! Lit 🔥
No words !The Music killed ! The melody of XU it's still in my ears ..
The fight coreography is new , and spontaneous.The guy , Simu - Lui perfectly synced in the Shang-Chi roleAbsolute blastEvery age group ,irrespective of sex,caste,creed can enjoy this film !",negative
486,"What began as a middling Marvel film was taken up a few notches thanks to some well done fight choreography and heart. I would have rated this a 9. However, Awkwafina's acting and/or character wasn't needed past the first act. She seemed out of place and shoehorned in much of the film. Her voice and presence was annoying. Moreover, the controversy surrounding her was a distraction though warranted. I really hope she isn't brought back.",negative
487,"This was a powerful film for Asians everywhere, as Marvel takes into an era of inclusion and expansion.Story wise, Shang Chi was good, not great, but solid. Displays Asian values perfectly. I found a few of the Chinese lines irritating to hear, as a native Mandarin speaker.The martial arts sequences were simply amazing. Fights scenes were captivating and beautiful, with superb special affects on top of the actual martial arts. With the Eternals coming up, Marvel is clearly upping its CGI and special affects making much more cinematographic films.My only complaint was the ending, went from one of Marvel's best into Godzilla. I don't think you'll find anyone praising it. A weak ending for an overall amazing film.",positive
488,BLOCKBUSTER in block capital letters. What a movie. Amazing experience and great CGI.,positive
489,"This movie is great, one if the best from marvel. 9/10 legendary rings.",positive
490,"Alright I get it, if you're not a fan of the character you're not gonna like it but I've watched movies before where I had no clue who the character was and it was still great because those movies made me care for them.I think the acting is pretty decent, the actors do a good job being funny and some of the action scenes are pretty awesome but that's already expected from a MCU production, my real issue with this movie is it's plot, it's a tale about a chinese warrior that doesn't use his abilities for sht even though he was raised to be a fighter and do something but instead he just runs away and hides in new york with this boring comic relief/love interest character, and leaves his sister behind not even caring about it, alright i can buy all that but where's his motivation?Then suddenly a guy with a sword in his arms appears and steals his necklace and he starts to do something about it, wow what an amazing chinese hero let's give some applause...Plus his dad/villain is totally forgettable, the whole relationship is poorly written, in one scene he says he's going to kill his dad and in the other he basically forgot about it, the dad doesn't have one scene of development, his character is weak af probably one of the worst antagonists in the MCU, the CGI dragons are pretty amazing but other than that it's just another formula marvel bull and totally forgettable.",negative
491,"Great visual at second half reminded me Kong, Godzilla Vs Kong, avatar and some recent Chinese movies. It has some of the best actions scenes in mcu.",positive

493,"It was such an awesome movie, something I would definitely watch again sometime. Now this film is definitely one of my top 5 films, the storytelling was amazing from start to finish. The action scenes in this movie were very Jackie-Chan/Bruce Lee stylish type of martial arts. Loved this movie! 10/10.",positive
494,"Watched Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings - despite the movie title sounding like one of those 1940s black and white ""Detective Dee and the...."" types, the film is visually stunning: stunning scenery, magical creatures, gorgeous costumes, no-holds-barred fight scenes that are as much dancing as fighting, you name it.I do have issues, however. The first is that I think Marvel was so worried about offending China or the Chinese people that the film comes across as very safe. Far too much on its dignity. If the film were a job interview, it would have been for the position of senior Vice President at the Chinese equivalent of the Louvre. Even Akwafina, who I usually count on to deliver a raunchy belly-laugh of a good time, was very composed and restrained.I'm also wondering why they bothered including Shang-Chi's sister. She doesn't really *do* anything except be moody and resentful for the majority of the film. Even in the after-scene, she's not there. As far as I can tell, the entire point of her inclusion in the film is to get Shang-Chi to Macau (bonus points for it not being the overused Hong Kong or Singapore!).Dignity or not, there was plenty of opportunity where they could have upped the humour quotient. The Chinese people are dignified - famous for it - but they also have a ribald and sophisticated sense of humour. I would have *loved* to see sly digs at Western culture, more commentary on differences between East and West (you can't tell me a guy spends his life in an isolated Chinese compound or in the States then just seamlessly segues to Macau's urban lifestyle!), that kind of thing - more than the stereotypical ""When are you getting married? When are you going to get a real job?"" conversation. Basically, they could have really *done* something with this movie, over and above a superhero story.One thing I *really* want to see is a guide to the creatures we see in the film. They are so beautifully rendered! The Fu Dogs, for example - I was mesmerized watching the tiny little movements - ear flicks, muscle twitches as if reacting to a bug bite, the movement of the fur and mane: magnificent! But there were so many others I have no clue what they were other than they looked like Chinese mythological creatures and I would love to know more about them.",negative
495,"Amazing choreography, incredible acting by the core cast. One of the few movies where you see so much heart in the main ""villain"" . Can't recommend this enough.",positive
496,"Marvel has proven over the past 13 years that they're able to take any character no matter how obscure or outlandish and give them a franchise that people are eager to see. Everything from a motley crew of galactic misfits to a man with shrinky powers, nothing is off-limits. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings this time introduces audiences to the titular character who simply has spectacular martial arts abilities. Compared to some of his big-screen peers Shang-Chi's USP and skill set may sound simplistic, but the truth is far from it.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings sees Shang-Chi try to escape his villainous father and his criminal empire and to instead live a normal simple life. Of course, this doesn't go to plan, and he must fight his father and the members of his shady organization. It is my pleasure to report that the film is a thrilling adventure that entertains from start to finish, delivering some of the best action scenes in the MCU to date as well as a surprising number of laughs. That's not to say the film is a comedy akin to Guardians of the Galaxy or Thor: Ragnarok, but its moments of levity come at the appropriate moments and land well.The master of kung-fu Shang-Chi is played by Simu Liu, who does an excellent job not only at the spectacular fight scenes but also in the scenes in which his fits are not colliding with a deadly ninja's jaw. In direct opposition to his father, Shang-Chi is a laid-back everyman with no grand ambition for his life. He's happy with his low-level job and loves a night out with his friends, not to mention the karaoke. He's charming and funny, and a welcome addition to the Marvel universe.Speaking of martial arts, you may be wondering; hang on, doesn't everyone in the marvel movies do some variation of martial arts? From Black Widow to Captain American, they're all capable fighters, is Shang-Chi really that much better? The answer is simply yes. Shang-Chi more than delivers when it comes to the fight scenes. Delivering tense, flowing, spectacular grounded fights that are a highlight of the film. They were truly fantastic, creative, and more than worth repeat viewings.If you've seen the trailer for the film, you'll know the film promises a lot, if you haven't, I won't ruin anything here, but if you're worried too much has been given away rest easy knowing that the film is stuffed with surprises and twists that will both shock and amaze you.It's no secret that Marvel heroes are likable and the films they're in spending a lot of time making the audience care about them, with a rich backstory and motivations anyone can empathize with. This is however often at the cost of the villain, who can sometimes prove to be underwhelming. Underdeveloped and unsympathetic they are more often than not the weakest part of the otherwise enjoyable movie. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings introduces Xu Wenwu aka The Mandarin, the leader of The Ten Rings, a word concurring criminal organization, in addition to being the wielder of the ten rings, ten mystical powerful rings which he wears as bracelets. The Mandarin is played by Hong Kong superstar Tony Leung Chiu-wai and is one of the film's greatest strengths and one of the best Marvel villains to date. He's bad for sure and does terrible things but he's not a mustache-twirling cartoon, he has believable motivations and is given ample screen time to develop into a complex character that any audience can emphasize. In addition to that, he is father to Shang-Chi, making their relationship complex and interesting.The finale ups the stakes in spectacular fashion, swapping out the grounded fights that have come before for something altogether grander. I found this to be one of the most entertaining and thrilling sequences of the film, but others may have different sensibilities and not feel the same. For me, however, it totally worked and undoubtedly one of the crazier things Marvel has done.Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings introduces audiences to a new character and a whole new corner of the Marvel universe, both of which are fleshed out and unlike anything that has come before. In addition to this the characters, both good and bad are equally pleasing with great motivation and rich backstories. Its connections to the wider universe are there, which will please many people, but the film more than stands on its own. It's true that before Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings many of the audience will have never heard of Shang-Chi before, but after they won't be able to stop talking about him.",negative
497,"This film isn't perfect, I felt like they honestly could have kept it going with the feel of the first half of the film and maybe save the more mystical special effects for a sequel, kind of felt like 2 movies jammed together. But regardless, both halves were great. I think the first half was a bit better and the ending got a bit jumbled with the CGI, but I feel like the more I watch it and am able to process everything the more I'll love it. All I know is I can't wait to watch it again, and I can't wait to see Shang-Chi with the other MCU heroes. Wenwu is one of the best MCU villains so far, maybe the best after Thanos. The humor was fantastic and the bus scene is probably one of the best scenes in the MCU. Choreography was brilliant, cinematography as well. I will say I wish they saved Razor Fist as a future villain (but then we wouldn't have gotten the insane bus scene), and definitely wish they went all out for Death Dealer, or saved him for a sequel as well. I thought he was such a badass character that we only got to see the tip of the iceberg of his potential. Super unique design to him. I do kind of wish Shang-Chi had a superhero name of some sort, kind of throws me off that his Marvel title is just his name, but I guess that's the case for Thor and Loki too. And some of the Netflix heroes if you count them. Anyways I'm really nitpicking now. But great MCU film. Still feels pretty formulaic, but it's own thing at the same time.",negative
498,"**Spoilers for Shang-Chi and Iron Man 3**The Mandarin is one of Marvels most iconic vilains. He is the arch enemy of Iron Man, like Joker is the arch enemy of Batman. In Iron Man 3, they made a total joke of the Mandarin. A fine actor, Ben Kingsley, was wasted for a bad caricature of Mandarin.The Shang-Chi movie ruins the Mandarin again. Because this movie was made by left-wing liberals who preach political correctness. Because they wanted to avoid anything which might be offensive or racist. Let me ask you, what is racist about an Asian man wearing traditional Asian clothes? And what is racist about an Asian man with long hair and beard? Exactly, absolutely nothing. That's how the Mandarin looks like in the comicbooks. In this movie, he has short hair, Western everyday clothes, looking like a random regular guy (boring), totally different name. Also, in the comicbooks, each of his rings has its own power, that means ten different powers. In this movie, all rings have the same power, so not even that is done right. In conclusion, this Mandarin has nothing to do with the original.By the way, this movie ruins Shang-Chi, too. He gets god-like powers, he could defeat the mighty Thor. Why??? Shang-Chi is a tribute to Bruce Lee, he doesn't have superpowers, martial arts is his skill. Why not making great martial arts movies with Shang-Chi instead of CGI superpower blockbuster stuff?People who gave high ratings for this movie don't know the source material, so they cannot judge.",negative
499,"Everybody was kung fu fighting for 2 straight hours and it´s just bad.It starts okay, then it just gets worse by the minute.If this is the new direction Marvel is headed, then it´s just sad.Really a bad movie and the story is rubbish, acting is bad and the best thing is that I saw it for free.",negative
